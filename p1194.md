<timemark seconds="396" />

theorized to be much healthier thought to be it's a it's a debate obviously it's always a debate with anything involving diet but I'm I just love it I love the way it tastes too alright that's it we did it folks whoo sober October it was a long 31 days we got through it and we didn't do anything other than exercise the entire 31 days because of this fitness challenge but I think we made up for it

<timemark seconds="428" />

I'm a pretty confident

<timemark seconds="431" />

in stating that I think we probably redid any positive results anything that we did good in the month of October was just destroyed by what we did in the last 5 hours how many hours was the podcast? four and a half hours

<timemark seconds="449" />

that's at least

<timemark seconds="453" />

an hour and a half too much

<timemark seconds="455" />

I'm sorry look we got trashed there was points in time where I could barely form sentences yet they kept flowing out as if I knew what the fuck I was talking about

<timemark seconds="465" />

but it was a fun time this is the sober October recap with Ari shaffir Tom Segura and Bert motherfuking Kreischer

<timemark seconds="478" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="486" />

boom it's over boy cheers we did it was Cheers Cheers first of all who is fucking stupid idea was to do this God damn fitness challenge Tommy buns a nice calm 15 hot yoga was not even close not even close to this was so much more difficult and I didn't expect this but I like it like that I think it's fun to be competitive with your friends yes it's a fun thing to do around but like like isolating something like this work out to you have no idea I don't think anyone anyone gets the real perspective when Joe is focused on something I've never seen me like that my fucking life

<timemark seconds="546" />

like everybody's competitive and this brings it out but like the funny thing was like burnt being like whatever Joe does I'll do double and another thing I didn't expect ever had I thought re would just be like whatever I'm just going to walk in the Eastfield I was worried about him I just think you were I don't know all these brain you were saying that you were texting like this is saying that he means it while he says it but he's also all to join in like 7 or 8 Days Inn and then you can be done know that I be like working out but now I'm too far away so don't try to catch up alright right

<timemark seconds="606" />

sneakery he was doing with me to your regular workout and see what your score is like taking that for a second you like this in the beginning I was like this is so stupid this is Jeff but then I was like why can't lose and then then I thought about it and I thought I was thinking was this what I was visiting my plan was my plan was to keep up with you guys for two weeks and then after 2 weeks to set us out a lot of time and about and a Lapis yeah but I'll just go psycho I was like I'm just going to go psycho I'm going to put up pace that I don't think anybody else can keep up with for like the last 2 weeks the last two weeks I just said I'm going to put in some 600. days I put in 1000 Point day that's that's what that's what I thought that's when I stop looking at you for contact like I was looking at the one we started this month and I put in my 700 Point day everyone's a little bit like wow

<timemark seconds="666" />

almost a marathon that day have no fucking clue I was just looking at my god damn phone all done to check if you get 70% your max heart rate is 3.2 minute if you get 80% your max heart rate or above that's four points a minute so we all try to stay in the 80 range that's where you get your money in that range beta 100 heavy workout is gives you 240 points and I'll tell you I was over after that it was the elk hunting day was mostly a hiking mountains day that was like a 600 point that that's when it when when you were there and you were actually working out in the mountains as well

<timemark seconds="726" />

what the fuck I made the mistake of jokingly saying oh I got them Joe's on an elk hunting vacation and the owners would like to. It's not a fucking vacation his work and I was like what you got a backpack on and you walk his money is the most I've ever walked to 12 miles in a day and you walking up and down in elevation you going up and down like I saved it one day cuz it was so ridiculous cuz I've gone up and down I forget it like a hundred and thirty flights of stairs something something fucking crazy I ended up getting your would you shoot on this end of thousand pound elk came back but the 935 Point day that was my big that was a thousand points did 935 in the day and then I did a podcast and then I did a hundred later on today to see Justice

<timemark seconds="785" />

probably see you guys anymore there is like I didn't have it I was a part of it was time management I was so I separate used part was like who had the most time to spend in the gym yeah yeah I was here to Mondays or last Monday and there was it was popping out of the comic stores going to hang out with everybody you know and there was like last time I got to get a couple hours then and that all your work out your workouts for so late they were all off pleading not what I want you go to bed and he found out all the work work around so he would build up work points in his tracker and then he Bluetooth it in the middle of the fucking night

<timemark seconds="845" />

can go out there at 2 in the morning yeah I thought you were uploading in the middle of the night know you could see the time the time that he was actually doing it yeah it's the Greeks were out yeah it was me, I thought that because re was so out of shape his heart rate was just skyrocketing like Ralphie want us there and I was in the yellow the whole time and re was barely in green and I was like oh he's in your he's in really good shape and then you did a task that you really bought that theory really hard and he was staying alive guy and then it goes there a lot like I'm about to go pick up. It's a it's a psychological thing has been working out it at all is in good shape yeah but I think you pushed yourself through the first week or two

<timemark seconds="905" />

yeah then you got in good shape and then okay first of all I had fallback plans okay was the plans K Michelle wolf offered to give let me just have her wear the thing wow day one that was definitely fall bike ride at solutely I'll wear for you I will stay in the right zone I'll tell knowing she feels left out on this is what we do like I don't do long cardio sessions I did five and a half hours on an elliptical after running for an hour and 35 points I'd I ran for an hour and then I stayed in the elliptical for five and a half hours

<timemark seconds="966" />

yeah I still going yeah just talk while I wanted to see how far I could go but the thought was like when you're tired how tired are you can you take another step okay can you take to okay can you take 3 can you just keep going I bet you can keep going let's see how long I can keep going and then you get to this point where you just just think about breathing just think about breathing in and out to just trying to stay almost like a meditative State trying to stay in his own and I was pouring sweat I set off the fire alarm that's why I was so much since I was like 4 hours in the story most people don't get to tell about themselves you know maybe an hour and also hit the bag I'll do some rounds I lift a little weight I'm not trying to kill myself like this was this was very interesting cuz I didn't I didn't know what how my body would respond till like a month of

<timemark seconds="1026" />

psychotic exercise did you do the things you got to the things where you would you be like the voice to say you got to quit quit Take a Walk for a little bit then go back to it and then if you just go like at 4.8 miles 500 yeah or like for like I'm almost at halfway through this hours let me just get the 30 minutes and I'll be down hill I can stop there a fuck with my obsessive compulsive this really bad yeah cuz I get to the place where I go all right I just want to get to 200 points and then I'm only at 950 calories only get to 1000 getting his own I'm going to go I'm just going to keep going I'm going to everyone's asleep I'm going to keep walking and dude it got bad with me to the point where I mean we'll talk we should talk about physical breakdowns in a little bit cuz I know all this dealt with some sort of physical breakdown but I was having nightmares that you guys had fun with my tracker was younger and lighter so I wasn't joking

<timemark seconds="1085" />

I woke up in a panic and panic and checked my phone and I was like okay I figured out pretty quickly that the way they do your max heart rate is your age minus a certain number minus your age and then you get from there then when you actually brought it all move up or down from there but right away I was like oh okay so I enter my age before I started I wrote to the myzone people and said my idiot wife Asian wrong I'm actually 7444 not 7444 the other way and profile yeah hold on I already set it as the other thing and so it'll

<timemark seconds="1145" />

say you have to then you have to have a brand new thing it didn't work so you stuff is a Ford yeah around casually turning yellow the whole time which I could have got that would've been saying yeah that was definitely a good sheet my mind I put that went wrong was I would have disqualified you still on the fence with these fucking 5-hour Heights he was taking well listen man hiking is work it is work going uphill for a long-ass bus you guys here on the rowing machine going hard for an hour I watched those cards we should really really keep ourselves from judging how hard are the people work every time

<timemark seconds="1205" />

bus show me the most hardest workouts for the shittiest my heart's workouts are running the hills and lifting weights if I run the hills it gives me almost 40 points less than if I just rode a bike or Road an elliptical machine as you. I take breaks I take like a deep breath when I get to the top of one he'll take the whole time too so that's a difficult points why I know I can make it too if I go full clip I'm going to try to extend a little bit I keep trying to send it but when I do that I'm going into the red and on top of going in the red it's like lifting weights are you need recovery time recovery time your heart rate crashes way low you can just do the elliptical machine and just good at it like 15 resistance so it's got some some give to it

<timemark seconds="1265" />

start sweating then you get into a Zone Yu-Gi-Oh machine makes it all but those even though like if you do intense workout recovery is going to be you know you're going to need it you're going to feel it those for like 6 days in a row there is still a fatigued right the boutique but I was speaking I would weaken over the moment was getting me was the pounding the running up the hills by the end because I was running miles in the Hills every day with those Minimalist Shoes on which man those things that they've they really do work like they really do work but the way they work is they make your feet work harder so if your feet aren't condition for that shit man that you fear like one of the first things that we're out like a nice spongy running shoe is just so much like smush smush

<timemark seconds="1325" />

free time you step on things if you get that and it's gone and you have this like really thin layer of rubber with some tread it's just your foot hitting the ground over and over and over again is very little you use in the Ultras as well the running shoe the ultra I was using one called zero and I was using of one cold Vevo vivobarefoot they're my favorite ones there their they're really good thing cuz I was wearing the five toe ones but Jam in my toes in this shit I'm running hard I'm tired exhausted cuz I'm just too exhausted through what your what a regular workout it was for you I'm a curious of what everyone's regular workout was what I would do is I would if I would run I would run for an hour just an hour just take my daughter milk because it gives its 2 things 1i he needs exercise he's young he loved it he loves to run with me and to its

<timemark seconds="1385" />

real good form of exercise it's like it's I know it's more beneficial than the elliptical machine it made my ass bigger made my legs bigger like they all got bigger like a specially like I feel weight pants fit different really really just weight lifting stuff for my legs I would do like squats or I would do cleans and presses and overheads you know do leg presses with kettlebells overhead Subway which is all great it's all really good stuff but it's not sustained motion is something about the sustained motion of running hills at I think boost your Vitality it gives you more energy does your your you have to work so it to run the hell is one of the boys things to do an exercise it's just you got a fucking just get your basement in like bodyweight squats with one Lego price

<timemark seconds="1445" />

when I went to hitting the bags what I would do is on on days I would do that I would run and then I would get on the elliptical machine or I'd run I get on the bike or Acro bike which is like to be picked up are diamonds she know since fuck you up or that assault thing the salt Fitness treadmill like that one I love it it's hard it's really hard it's not a treadmill and extra bumper than running on the road running on the road on the road and it's really beneficial in other treadmill for that one is a mistake it's harder than running my head that that was not forgiving like so glad I wore you out needs to do a real it's called on a result fitness trainer the rear Runner

<timemark seconds="1505" />

I love it I love it I get on that thing it's like he doesn't hurt your knees it doesn't stop pounding it's got a good amount of give to a big red to it and it just got enough shocks that is your running you don't feel like it's a big pounding on your joints but it's all self-propelled so you really get a good rhythm going and you fucking likes to Tire what's great for it is sprinting on it you can get your heart rate go to be able to either be distracted by meditating and getting into some sort of a weird breathing zone or you got to listen to podcasts or you got to listen to music books on tape did the best really when I was out in the wild that was on the wild I was listening to books on tape I'd like something thinking about something distracted me from the physical exertion of exercise indoors

<timemark seconds="1565" />

it was two things helped violent movies watching fights guys get hit and your fucking honest think before you know what you're not returned a kickoff return so yeah and I was like oh my God that's what I'm doing I'm getting I'm allowing myself to get so caught up in this movie then I'm like fighting in the red dude I got to give a shout out to run the jewels run the jewels is perfect fucking Canada music Killer Mike dude

<timemark seconds="1625" />

run man run them Jewels at Church Portland I meant nothing when I think when I think about this month I'll think I'll take it to things I thank God it's over and brought them to run the goddamn Jewels that's all I listen to running will give you like 10% more an hour yet what it takes to drive and you just start going and going I get real excited I was before the angry if I come in a fight somebody but put on a little out of Public Enemy Public Enemy I feel like that's good too that's good to know got to do the first week if I can necklace thing out there I want to eat your Netflix special

<timemark seconds="1685" />

how's your rainy jokes while you're running

<timemark seconds="1688" />

I don't think I did a job at the gym I wrote so many goddamn jokes and stroke stroke I'm going to win

<timemark seconds="1714" />

I just I thought I was like you whatever you think you can do let's keep going let's see what happens and what that's a weird switch that goes off it's like let's see who's willing to die of oh my God I just saw was like danger that that just became a price for a second yeah that's fucked up message Us by the way I was going to die because what I said is that I have heard some negative opinions about CrossFit from experts that I trust like Steve Maxwell I'm not a fitness expert by any stretch of the imagination I don't know where the Norcross it's bad or good I bet it's probably based on your application the way you do it because of somebody asked me to do just too good for your body I be like well I've had a bunch of surgeries yeah buddy I know that surgeries ever

<timemark seconds="1774" />

rhinos does jiu jitsu gi Oregon he didn't get his blue belt to get surgery but I did say they are tree-hugging hippies who will I get there yoga black belt I want a yoga block. I love yoga black felt like a blue belt in yoga dude halfway through the month I told Thomas the other day and he laughed so I tried it on stage and it worked but I stop producing semen just call them dust dude my dick have the dry heaves just for that I'm so tired so tired how about those sleep so I was sleeping like a fucking perfect person like most the time the way I live is zero anxiety view of the world that you

<timemark seconds="1834" />

get from a rigorous exercise but I think that there's we have too much of a history as a species of constantly avoiding danger and I think we live in a place that's far to safe for a Natural Instincts and so we're constantly looking for things to be bad or looking for things to be dangerous or confronting confronting her own mortality and putting it on the back burner and letting all that weirdness manifest itself and all sorts of other fears fears about the government fears about economics and fears about this and I think we're dealing with this as human beings all the time and I think there's only a certain amount you can do and I think when you have rigorous exercise it puts in perspective what that certain amount actually is and what you can control as a person the you can you can just chill your body out and look at this whole thing for what it is it is what it is you know what we're going to be fine or we're not and then what it won't matter but this this this whole thing that we

<timemark seconds="1894" />

do when we do this we do this because our body has a need for exercise it has a built-in need it's got an engine that needs to be pushed and if you don't push it starts fucking with you and starts fucking with you and ask me weird questions like what the fuck I think he is I can wants to start problems he wants to get upset if things don't make any sense to be upset it once conflict is a part of you that wants conflict because it thinks that conflicts a part of the programming cuz it's been our way from millions of years so whatever the fuck we were then to whatever the fuck we are now has been conflict along the way people been trying to eat us things about trying to kill us and this is the only time ever that there's none of that I think the only time you could see things with perspective is when you blow out all the biological shit whether it's jerk-off like how many times have you jerked off and then had a totally different opinion person about not called people like why would I call this person after I just jerked off but no now I see I see what this whole is

<timemark seconds="1954" />

play some weird biological trick playing some stupid game I'm so high

<timemark seconds="1962" />

hi spot. I love I'll tell you what this one month did for me it got me back in spin class I love spin class but I don't know what to say just make you spend at the time when we talked I said I had Bob Harper is my spend teacher one time in the thing you said about want me to go back and fuck to bug her up with her whatever is Bob Parker the Kobe Bryant of spin classes from Biggest Loser Bob Harper and so I got

<timemark seconds="2001" />

by like I like the I like the the way they talk to you and see what I want I like closing my eyes I like the flowers to break a sweat I like I love what I love and I have to say I did give props to people more than anything with re doing that rower redefine the way I had to look at working out so I went he was an 80% like I know what it feels like that was a tough one it's none of them are harder than others to keep it 80% Viking which is way harder to do that that but I don't know quite how much you were still angry but even with our he's playful angry it's still energy right like that anger like the anger that he gave the everybody on that fucking podcast

<timemark seconds="2061" />

around doing a podcast talking shit about us. It said 70% it's brilliant it's brilliant but it's it's an urgent see that kind of anger that like that too in you or it's not a new already had its about her getting the alleged fired up again once a week like somebody that I know of and I still hadn't done it until this and I member you were fucking trying hard you know and I remember one time you legitimately swept me legitimate I'll tell you that a hundred percent

<timemark seconds="2112" />

truth is what happened he was we were rolling together and I was like okay dude let's just do this so you know I'm not going to hurt you I'm cool on top of them and I just got a little relaxed and all sudden boom already Hip Hop's takes my leg up I'm out of being swept me I'm like you mother so I knew apart of re that you guys didn't know cuz all right contestant knowing what he's capable of just a field true helplessness because if you if you can handle it then at least you know where you are on this little weird food chain of who can kill who with their bare hands and then you also know that whatever these people know you can learn too that's not a physical thing like I know guys that are so much weaker than me that can fuck

<timemark seconds="2172" />

if we roll together they're going to tap me 100% of the time my friend anyways 160 something pounds I've never I may not happen when he was young where you go to kills me really strangles me these triangles me way better way more focused been doing it with you to have the time to get serious about something we have the time to get serious about this when you have the time to get serious by the way it's time to just did it like 4 or 5 days before it starts true and like an average has been probably 20 300 points or something

<timemark seconds="2232" />

show me where they said there's a million registered users first of all and where is 0.1% okay but hold on and have it on we're not really not unless everybody was actively all use here whoever is using it I don't know but that's a fair point because like we really don't know what percentage of those people actually keep it right people trying to kill people were trying if we had to guess we all agree on a number would you guys say that like half the people would use it regularly or know there's a million people would you leave your behalf by the time I .5 would be .5% percentile whatever 9.5% tile a variable but I think that

<timemark seconds="2292" />

those other people are at the top or probably Fitness instructors and that's was that's what Myspace Myspace $15 and say please wear this I want you to my plan the whole month what was your plan do not get hurt those number one gift if I get hurt I think you were at any time so I can have it hurt your ankle or something how excited are you excited

<timemark seconds="2344" />

what time do it but I got I got I swear to God I'll call my fucking wife right now Jackson dancing Jackson Mich in Samson and the one he told me he was sick and he took photos of his medication and I know you were right back to full speed now thank you re thank you alright that's not true I was thinking $150 and that was the beginning of the second worst day and I put it on I was like I'll just get that and I walk down the street and I was like I felt so sick I got 40

<timemark seconds="2404" />

yeah true the next day I was able to get like I think a hundred and something in that was split up into also that's what I was like I'm pretty okay Bert we're not coming last that's great let's just be casual with the two of us Toms. That's great that's awesome something this is like something that we should all point out for health like I've been over the last couple years I've been eating a lot of kimchi a lot of fermented cabbage and a lot of Kombucha a lot but here's the thing all that healthy like probiotic stuff that has a big impact on your immune system me really big I haven't got sick in a long time so good they taste good too healthy for you I had a Whole Foods guy tell me that I had just so you know I saw you drink this in the thing it's fine if it's going to

<timemark seconds="2464" />

so you can't you can't drink that in the in the store and I was like listen I'm going to do it every single time so you can just try to catch me if you want but thank you for the warning you did your job than a half a percent of it is that what it is they have to it's more than my daughter's drink kombucha in the morning drink to get drunk in a store and then apparently what was going on was they were there was a strong brew and they would sit there for menting and then when they would test them after they had fermented for a while to alcohol content would get over one half of 1% which is like somewhere around where they need to draw the line looking to get a non-alcoholic beer it's going to touch up the booze in it really really truly all right

<timemark seconds="2524" />

you know there's a there's no saying to everybody that when this was over when the whole thing was over if somebody made a pill that made me feel how I feel when I have those hard workout that I take that pill every day was going to tell you earlier pill that I felt so much relief but I feel like it was totally tied two days where I really work hard like one of the it was like a medium work out too good but on the days where it was like three plus hours of working out and I was totally like spent that I felt the most I mean I know a part of that physically just two guys hired what I had zero stress while you're doing it you got to be off your all your technology for a while I know you

<timemark seconds="2859" />

decided to create the shoot where they have CO2 cartridges hit literally change big wave surfing it say it's only fucking lives is my bow hunting buddy yeah he lives he lives at like a big island in Hawaii every year we do the the spring Axis deer hunt on the island of Lanai really you show me just like brothers my favorite thing he said in that podcast was when he goes you can we do for fitness because I don't push myself not healthy know this is what I wanted to talk about not sustainable

<timemark seconds="2919" />

class and try to do on evenings try to do by the way that's the 31st I got to talk to you but that last work out I was dead I couldn't I couldn't have gone that much further in all honesty after my piss came out of weird color I really did have Phantom pains in my kidneys I really was like maybe that was wasn't just dehydration or something more maybe there's something going on I really did have some weird Phantom idea that there was a pain but good man yeah cuz the whole thing was that the lot of that rhabdo in here's the thing about it's called rhabdo myelosis is that a saying that I say it right rhabdo has actually been the source of death for a few Fighters

<timemark seconds="2971" />

where are guys got really beat up in a crazy really difficult fight and the thing that did the men was they were probably over trained and they probably did too much in the gym didn't give themselves enough time to recover and then had a really brutal fight alright so when you were young in particular your your little too wild and you don't recognize it there's like this point of diminishing returns when it comes to training oh yeah well see we pushed into some weird placemat we did get through that a few times and it worked for us I wouldn't work for a fighter no one's kicking our ass to think about when you're a fighter is if someone kicking your ass you might push even pass where we pushed in terms of like output in any particular hour or any particular you know what half hour 40 minute session you might go too far where is we would just keep going on at 80% sometimes you get forced into 90% sure

<timemark seconds="3031" />

periods of time especially if someone's better than you or specials you're tired from training so allow these guys are going into the fight especially in like younger guys who don't have maybe the most scientific coaches are going into the street where we went out of it like that but you know six 8-week camp like that like they might be broken down like real early on just push themselves through the whole thing and then they have like at the end of it there body's failing it haven't given themselves enough time to recover and that's what this rhabdo shit is your muscles and it has something to do with proteins that your muscles pull up the actual at cuz I'm given a really stupid definition of what Rhabdomyolysis is

<timemark seconds="3079" />

am I pretty close what is it releasing a damaged protein into the blood shut down November 2nd my muscles all felt sore for the first time all month mine felt so right away and then not again for a while when you get out of the saddle of Sprint is I just got your place for my legs were always fucking wasted and I was like I want to get I want to try this again when I'm my legs just aren't wasted they were always wasted I could now at the end of this I can run to the gym and back I got stopped like three times in the way in a run for like 2 minutes and I got like we are running late I could run I ran 12 miles on the like V last day on antibiotics

<timemark seconds="3139" />

sorry I always down. I always do the other strong mind I always knew you had a strong mind you're an angry man was strong mind but I didn't I didn't appreciate it as much as I appreciate it this month for you to do it is the most impressive out of all of us because you didn't do shit other than like the occasional hiker fuck around and play basketball for like 10 years but also I did you guys eat like garbage I just want to fight 75 to 80 I should be around 175 that's what you asked what about significantly

<timemark seconds="3189" />

you guys were actually working out you can eat fucking normal idiots towards the end of it towards the end I started I hear you know you apart maybe I'm the person by the listen to this podcast the most you hear people talk about health and how they eat and you only not challenge the very last week I started going looking at food at tad bit differently going like I don't want to feel like shit I don't want pizza I don't want I didn't want carbs I wanted protein cuz I get done to work out when I go let's do for eggs and some and it's take old water buffalo steaks and I was like it which it is so crazy is I never I was like water yeah I need water on Earth Wind plane you know when they walk by with a little basket and I was like

<timemark seconds="3249" />

that whole five and a half hours on the elliptical I ate a box of animal crackers and a drink cream soda while you were doing it seems like I was possessed I was in the craziest state of mind I was like I am going to I was like I am going to keep this going like I'm now I'm going now it's just numbers to me now it's like when do you get off so you get off at 400 no 500-600 misfires I had some misfires I had some light like my body was like look like settle down bitch it's like we need we better get off this thing soon I was like okay that's just a little bit and I actually APA then you feel weaker like my ankles at one point did you nap

<timemark seconds="3309" />

no I would not napping was the year the Florin app where you just like sit in your bed for second and almost I just go out like a light at the end of the night yet cuz that's what I'm moving you sleeping tonight like a Deadman 7 hours dead man Dead start having the marijuana dreams you got to know who's coming so I tapered off tapered off all through September and also I was on a lot of hunting trips to go to James on those little bit a little bit but you you know I decided early on with all that stuff that I wasn't I just want to experience it as a is it like an actual human I didn't want to ever be drunk and I didn't really want to be high or I don't want to take beta-blockers I don't get nervous I try to experience it as a

<timemark seconds="3369" />

it's just experience what it is I saw Adam Greentree like kill some Elkins wherever the funky Izzy's days and a bear claimed it as I use my shampoo and a grizzly bear claimed it and covered it with dirt right away a moose is probably like 1800 lb there so big. I got a big elk a little Rocky Mountain else like eight hundred pounds it's a big one a Moose's a thousand pounds bigger than that when it's fully mature so something that's what Adam shot shot a gigantic moose so they can only carry so much of it out like this hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pounds of meat 1800 pounds of boost might be 7 800 lb of it is meat so you have to take it out and load so if you have two guys right you're taking out several load so they took out one pack out then they came

<timemark seconds="3429" />

in a giant grizzly bear I cleaned it and covered it up and the grizzly bear was still in the area oh yeah when there's a lot of blue bleeps in the story when I go in at in Greentree and he's got a hundred little. I go all is going to be a good one yeah it's Adam. Green Tree on Instagram and he's he's a bow hunter from Australia Australia is an interesting place because one of the reasons why I mean he's he's just a real smart guy and I really he said he's a real deal but you should see the floor he has in his hunting cabin he took do this guy's like across the board every part of a man you want to be human is Florida's hunting cabin is fucking amazing and he did it himself by and let's just established per capita Australians are more manly

<timemark seconds="3489" />

just a Man lyrics they're manlier breed of people and also you have to realize that Australia was a goddamn prison Colony so these are the ancestors of Scoundrels they all got big thumbs this is a big ass moves that he shot in the Yukon and a grizzly bear claimed it and so they they went back to it and the grizzly bear run off cuz he saw them coming I guess and so they just stole what they couldn't get the fuck out of there before they panicked work came back to the unburied it The Dugout did Big Stuff adding stuff out but they were scared out of their second of my friends that has had grizzly bear and counters over the last 3 or 4 years it was on I saw it on Instagram which one of your buddies who got it who got charged by the grizzly bear

<timemark seconds="3549" />

Grizzly Man oh my God it's crazy documentary ever grexit by bear dude I was with I wanted to give him a hug back into the audio

<timemark seconds="3584" />

turn it up his voice makes it sound weather

<timemark seconds="3590" />

wow yeah that's a grizzly bear and he's got a gun pointed at her and she's got her Cubs and he might try you know what she might charge him

<timemark seconds="3599" />

give me the scariest one of the females with Cubs yeah that's in Real Life 2

<timemark seconds="3605" />

and what about the pistol pistol out and here's the thing the pistol it was the wrong size bullets so wouldn't have rack normally so see how it is right now it looks like he's discharged all the ammo like his guns out cuz it's jammed so he doesn't even know it's jammed so he's standing out there pointing a gun that the only way I could get a bullet in it as if he opened up the barrel himself stuck the bullet in and then close it so we have one shot no matter what so the whole magazine wouldn't fit it was off that the differences in the size of the ammunition was off didn't see it nope he didn't notice cuz he doesn't use guns he's a bowhunter you only he got a gun just to protect himself from that thing those kind of things cannot believe how excited I just got monsters are real I believe that we talked about on the podcast

<timemark seconds="3665" />

about the way was charging with hair was popping up on it and you could see it and then it stopped it false charge them so I charged them and stopped within like you know 5 yards of them

<timemark seconds="3676" />

wow that's a giant female grizzly bear and that would just tear you apart the only for the trying to get you to do leave trying to get you to leave but it doesn't trust him it doesn't know him so it's closing in on him and looking at him and deciding maybe whether or not he's a threat and moving in on him so he can't get away from it so he was stuck in this position we couldn't get away from it it it decided that he was a problem so he was trying to get away and he was moving in a different direction it was cutting them off and then it was like oh shit and he's got his pistol out and I think Tara to I have the Appalachian Trail when I was in college and not the whole thing just a portion and man that fucking I had no idea about Grizzlies you're a good man

<timemark seconds="3725" />

the grizzly things fucking scary man yeah so scary I've never seen one in the wild except once in Alberta I've never seen like a big one the one I saw and Albert was one of like 6 feet wasn't a big one what is enough to look in his eyes and go whoa that is a different thing as a black bear doesn't look at you like that man black bears if you run into a black bear in the woods it look to you like what are you what are you doing Grizzly on the East Coast brown bears and then those the ones that live on the coast and then everything that's interior is called a grizzly bear that's how you get the name yes it's the same as brown bears usually bigger than a Grizzly cuz they have more access to this thought the thought is that the Kodiak brown bears that you ignore Miss ones which are the biggest waves deep calls then 11:00 11:50

<timemark seconds="3785" />

vanilla he has a podcast about it on a podcast called me earlier that's his podcast and it's all about a fog neck Island it's a two-part podcast It's fucking amazing they shot an elk and then same thing they hung some of it up and they came back to get it and after they pack some of it out and when they came back grizzly bear cleaned it and they didn't know it so they were trying to pack out that food was that the rest of the meet and when they did a bear charge down and ran through their camp and they said it was all 11 ft tall he was with my friend Yana's protelus my friend Remi Warren Warren I heard and these and I may be one of the guy I mean no all these hunters and I've never hunted in my life I think there's like a merman there's a bunch of people and it's enormous 11 foot bear ran through the camp and they said it was the biggest fucking thing it was so different than anything they could have expected they said

<timemark seconds="3845" />

move so fast and teeth were so close to them they said the electric Ronaldo when he describes that he just has a brilliant guy but he's also the very well-read guys very eloquent he has a degree in journalism he's like he's a super fucking smart so when he describes this interaction between them and 11 foot Coastal brown bear what you like the biggest bears on next to the grizzly do like the polar bears bigger but they like the coastal brown bears of Kodiak Alaska that every other there's big and yet and is so big polar bears spotted scariest Jeff I really want to save them because of Klondike Bars and fucking come through ice seals under the ice and what did you just see that the the like the wildlife footage and I just sniff ice and then they put their paws together and they start dropping all their body weight down

<timemark seconds="3905" />

jumping is pull out of see if it's fucking nuts that part of our brains like there's a part of

<timemark seconds="3916" />

funny polar bear jeans is a reason why you have an iPhone you have no fucking nice house or do you have TV and a nice car that's cuz you don't you have no polar bear polar bear jeans though for sure probably some of your funk by a bear hug and pretty fucked up yeah crazy about this month is inspirational people on Instagram like to listen to them now to really draw inspiration I got one more last name of Kim hands fucking shit man when you go and put him one of those days and realize he's running a marathon everyday lunch break baby just in his defense he would never he would step in and probably say right now that's not sustainable for like the whole year will he does all 200-plus mile race

<timemark seconds="3976" />

can I see where the guy went to tell them of victory in Marathon I was a pussy cam Hanes it's not you should do marathons the message is the best way to kill I read chams how do I change my socks, and I liked it he he he sincere I get it we have to pretend to be impressed one leg hotel in like I Ran 2 miles today

<timemark seconds="4036" />

battle dude wears cowboy boots most of the days that I read those comments because he's like good job person that like I ran around a hundred yards today he's a good guy running a marathon and yes that's impressive it's trying to tell you he's one of my best friends the guys the nicest guy in the world and he started out not being able to run for shit he started out doing a mile and fucking dying and going how the hell could anybody ever run a marathon and then he just kept doing it's crazy that he got to this point we could run Ultra marathons he runs a hundred miles a year it's impressive that you ran a marathon because he knows you so well as run so many he knows what somebody who can run a marathon looks

<timemark seconds="4096" />

and then when he saw you he was like that's it for an hour for a year and then I tell you they just did an hour you like wow that's impressive how much time you do you know I did an hour ago wow that's impressive cuz yeah I'll be like to look at it if someone who's like maybe one of your opening acts God doesn't hour 15 minutes in Cleveland somewhere you look how many that you did that about an asshole

<timemark seconds="4156" />

you like this picture I would like an hour and Madison like what wait hold on what are not to an hour anymore cuz I know a lot about 2:45 or 5:30 and 1515 31st which is an hour and a half show which is most people think their attention span is which is like it's kind of accurate I mean like we're just you know it's too short to be pushing it for a 90-minute show me more

<timemark seconds="4216" />

is it Rachel mistake of doing long set swear I did a lot of stand up in it was rocking and rolling for a while then I do like you in ages of people who go on too long you going to be because I know for a fact that like it's not right for me but for you a few and I will be interesting wouldn't be interesting it would be more interesting if people didn't see an hour and a half a comedy first see if they that's the problem the problem is not whether or not a good stuff there probably is how much good stuff you want all day long what you want nobody wants your dick sucked 8 hours a day or two I got to do things ever try for it if you get an hour and 20 of really solid, date and then was that I took you today for a while to be different than I spend the whole festival that we stand up now let's have some fun times I think I think the closer you are to 60 if it's polished and good that's the best

<timemark seconds="4276" />

hang on but where none of us are all know I'm not doing that right now I won't say I won't speak for everyone but I'm not doing that right now in that I'm working on my 62 in order to work on my 66 that's it for the working progress is the ideas. When do you think about it as a thing where people want to see what you've got it like lockdown perfectly from start to finish you really want an hour and a half and you want your opening act to do at least 20-25 minutes ago 15 you're welcome I bring Tony Hinchcliffe all the time in Edwards those guys are headliner is so funny the funniest mother fucker

<timemark seconds="4336" />

because he should be a household fucking name I've been saying that forever man I started out as well yeah I'm at Pilot in 2002 3 window to Pauly Shore thing in Miami and rode it was I who done with Jose and I was like oh yeah I know from what I hear something about Ian he's a he's a brilliant writer Tuesday on sitcoms and all these other different shows and one things about writing gigs is first of all very convenient you don't have to go anywhere I stay in town and you get paid a nice amount of money you make good money it's hard to pass up on but the problem is you not out there building your name in different cities and building up markets and you're not putting out a lot of comedy specials you only have that one CD on Team Coco records called a hundred percent half-assed it's fucking hilarious but really you got to see him live

<timemark seconds="4396" />

like his timing is fucking genius I don't like I forever he said the nicest fucking person you're ever going to meet to but you still think it's got so many haircuts open jokes around a crowd and they were lie on someone getting offended sometimes when you say something horrible but since it's all, that was what I call you but no one gets offended but Ian is will feel like I need that thank you all my gigs getting ready for my last Netflix special we're all with Ian or with Tony a couple with Santino

<timemark seconds="4455" />

mother fucker I like to suck so much about the shoes he's wearing these guys are coming up man Tony Hinchcliffe was murdering it to kill Tony is legit a sell-out show it's a legitimate shot it's a great idea he is he is so good at roasting oh yeah he is a little murderer he makes me blush sitting next to us bro light someone up and you hit him and you don't want us back when he starts with light up

<timemark seconds="4506" />

the next. Show the format is so genius up when did they add it suck to get the whole combinations great Jeremiah Watkins Jeremiah Jeremiah Jeremiah is a fuck he's all over the map but I feel Tony Comics that back in the day when we were coming up no one ever gave us props for being funny and young and right now when did I change and stand up where everyone was like it became a community where I go and wanted the people see people succeed came up I felt loses weird unnecessary competition to people cuz I come from a world of competition so I was like why you guys pretending you're competing competing but you just your

<timemark seconds="4566" />

there's a few people that I only get certain roles and things but the way to look at it correctly was not that you're competing the way you look at it correctly in my estimation was it we're helping each other like when I see you I see you kill I get inspired I see some new bit that's like really well crafted and and and hits man surprises me I get inspired and I think that when you see comics in a vacuum like I remember when I was coming up I would go in these weird tours we do a weird show and some weird Town had a local scene and local scene was almost always have a key but there's a few scenes of were weren't hockey like Houston wasn't happy there was a lot of Pride and not being happy Boston was very not hacking New York was on a key Florida was hacking right places

<timemark seconds="4626" />

first started how hacking my ideas were how shity they were but I got lucky that I was around guys like Lenny Clarke and Barry crimmins and you know and then after that waive it was Lucy Kay and Marc Maron and there was a lot of it was all these guys that nobody ever heard of it we're really good but super ethical about their material and like really sharp about you broke the fuck meter you said fuck too much like it when you say it it ruins it for everybody I do it explain like yeah. I remember thinking why isn't about just do that for everybody like all over the place why does everybody like treat this as if there's like a famine situation going on and there's a small amount of, Defense no bitch you can't be in Cleveland every night and I'm going to be in Denver and you going to be in Detroit we're supposed to support each other this is so stupid with the only people that understand each other

<timemark seconds="4686" />

terms of like like what a bizarre human being it takes to be on stage rowkin with your broken changes the internet this is why because before the internet everybody was like I want to be the next host the Tonight Show and Jay Leno retires and I'm the next konad but I'm on cable everybody had the idea of being one person who stood out in a limited amount of slots and then the internet came around and no longer is there a limited amount of slots slots instead if you it's hard to remember but when I first started doing the acting shit it's hard to remember what it was like back then no internet and everything was on either NBC ABC CBS or Fox that was it and there's a few like VH1 MTV things it was famine but there's one person I want of 20 people who say yes you're in and then that's it or you're not

<timemark seconds="4746" />

search for MTV and this list for HBO Comedy specials in this was for all these things yeah it was good in that the people that got through were very high-quality right. Sometimes a lot of them if you look back at the comics that become became big off HBO they have the best record I thought if you had Chris Rock at HBO special Louis CK I mean Carlin Carlin had one a year for how long the year that 16 / hen need you to new hour every year and I would I went to one I got to see him run the last one of the second to last one at the store no fucking I wish and he was and he would run it always the night before I learned later at comedy magic club which I live nearby for a while but he I got to see him do it at Universal Amphitheatre when that was to a thing and it for his like closing bit

<timemark seconds="4806" />

he had it written down I told you about 6,000 person audience you working it like it was a fucking Cheney hunting person room he told her that he read the whole last bit because it was really worried monologue and he was like I got to see him on the or do this what it would do he would write a new monologue essentially it would tighten up a little bit over the course of the year I thought this was a dog the whole time for some reason to wear with what is it just a cord but I wasn't really alright yeah I was like I thought I did and then I just realize it was a rat just so funny that was so racist against rats be at squirrels get a free pass a squirrel in the house I'm trying to put a net over and bring the little fella outside I'm trying to kill everybody here

<timemark seconds="4866" />

soccer and someone said the only difference between squirrels and rats are their tails and I will forever y'all fuck off worlds team squirrel son yeah this month freak you out like when it was over when it's all said and done like November 2nd maybe I woke up I don't know what the fuk just happened how did I go from living this lie completely normal life of Life podcast gas you have to do to be involved this fucking insane battle to the death yeah I mean you know what occurred to me is like this probably doesn't occur to you because of hot like your history with working out but I had that exciting but disappointing thought of like wow you know I can't believe how much I was able to do oh I can't believe how much I'm able to do and

<timemark seconds="4926" />

I don't ya and that's all I got was in the last five yeah that's right to be it was like I could be doing a lot more than a lot more it's Dad's it's definitely not to do if I can get there for an hour running and an hour of Weights twice a week I'd be like this is amazing that's Health yeah I mean good number what's how many days is 2 hours to days to our like 45 minutes 45 minutes you been looking good no daddy no no no no this change my whole fucking way of looking to working out this is me or if you're good to Mama

<timemark seconds="4986" />

you do have another hard there's a there's a DVD that I follow it's called the Kettlebell extreme cardio workout but it's got Keith Weber was a past guests visit the dude that hits by himself in a fungus a couple different variations with one of me did on a beach instantly did he just takes a 35lb kettlebell and not heavy but you do it for 40 minutes 40 minutes we got a little bro. Possible time so that I could barely walk I could barely walk I was hobbling a good start but I did the second to last day I did 15 minute rounds with that guy with mitts

<timemark seconds="5046" />

I thought about I was trying to get my legs a rest too and then so it so that was what prompted me to start it and then when I would do when I was doing it I would just think about pointing Bert and then I was just pointing it was great motivator I did something I did not come in last one little heads-up seriously you're welcome everybody because all of you were beating me and there was a part of me that definitely felt very alone that's not true because I never thought you could ever beat me I wasn't. Hahaha

<timemark seconds="5081" />

<timemark seconds="5157" />

<timemark seconds="7697" />

Yearwood I took my wife slapped the further you know just cuz I'm just like y'all to her for a while okay go ahead he's just he's just I think he's very sincere I believe it but there's something fucking weird going on there and I think he's got a couple bodies in the trunk I just don't I think there's something going on I think it's somebody you know how how there's something about like when you watch me where are you remember back to Michael Jackson and you're like like I got weird for obviously but also how in comprehensible is it to be as famous as he is or was Michael Jackson Garth Brooks laich for me the part that's that's a reach or whatever is that none of my friends are over like a men do you like new Garth Brooks track like I don't have anyone in my life talking about him

<timemark seconds="7817" />

seems almost like a foreign entity right like I just go the country fans did you ever like my name is stuff all time fun drinking song that's one of them to relax. Relax have a couple Tequila's in you I can appreciate some Hank Williams stuff I'm not knocking somebody that regularly or that I even talk to someone like going to Garth Brooks's way and then generoso Waylon Jennings his social media is that special it is remarkable

<timemark seconds="7877" />

he saw it on his W I don't know how he put He just pulls the best content edits it amazingly and he he put up a bunch of Garth since his Instagram stuff it's right experiences or if we should do a stadium tour where we just can't get comfortable music that

<timemark seconds="7962" />

here's the thing he was like we're going to do this and stadiums were normally UC football teams so wear your favorite football team's uniform and then let's get physical while we're making you know what is weird about you know like my dad would say yeah go ahead that happened for a little while we're if you if you were to theatrical, once we get upset at you but if you moved around too much yeah you got physical he acted things out people would literally like Shawn you I just a few people that are you doing why are you doing that

<timemark seconds="8000" />

yeah that was a style for a while remember hearing someone talk I want to say it was in the movie comedian Jerry Seinfeld going if I have a bit I'll act it out cuz if it gets a bigger laughing that's the purpose and I'm over feeling Vindicated so super physical when I started weird why would anybody looking like more like shit than I do naturally that would be like if this shirt has a hole in it where it to do it yeah really yeah for a while for a while I was like oh you should look for some reason I don't know why I bought into that I was like you should just look what your mom's house fans are taken away squash bitch

<timemark seconds="8046" />

<timemark seconds="8509" />

I don't want to come from you it's like a source of some dude

<timemark seconds="8530" />

he puts on his Blog the next to you did not want Joe Rogan is next on my list navigate to Internet it's possible though if you don't make it very clear that it's like talking but I'm always looking out for your best interest. I grew that till this point I always thought then I was the most vaulted but the way you talk makes me think he said you might also be having my understanding of life with someone share something with you. Just dies with you if you tell me that that dies with me I will never betray you 12 years ago there's different levels of people telling you something and their stuff we're like you make the judgement your like this some bullshit

<timemark seconds="8590" />

oh and tell people somebody tells you something and it's actually something that could affect their life yes and there's a 0% chance I would ever say something to you show me something like severe I promised you would never have to worry about me saying let me stamp kids probably talk about this but if one reality is it sometimes one of your friends will say something that's disturbing yeah and you're not sure if you have talked to somebody about it like I think about killing myself are like yeah yeah okay then had to deal with that I didn't know anybody who would who would did Hood gone to that place yet cuz I'm close to killing myself place and I don't I've known people that have Kik

<timemark seconds="8650" />

but I never knew anybody who can fight it in me there were thinking of killing the best say I've never had so much fun time together so much traveling on the road together so many gigs we had a lot of fun so I didn't understand I was like you you're really hilarious comedian your professional comedian you doing what we all want to do everything is happening and then you're you're depressed but there's a there's a situation going on I don't know what the fuck it is but doesn't make any sense to me I've never had anybody can find me that's where you like somebody's make the best what I think is a decision instead of just going like I want to share this stuff with your final. Opened up about some shit that I was like okay I don't I can't be responsible for this just based on my own personal judgment cuz I don't I don't understand this.

<timemark seconds="8710" />

and I was like I got to figure out what to do and then I reached out to friends who told me about psychiatrist and then we got together and we but the like so that's a good share information yeah exactly I called you tell me if I tell you you're going to respect it I will absolutely I think you and I are on the same level with that where it's not a question of what the line is is just know if you have a no you have never fuck me up I can come out of course I saw you were so bad as I thought I would not sell you out I would not tell you I believe that will set them free

<timemark seconds="8770" />

<timemark seconds="9007" />

<timemark seconds="9169" />

go to my Instagram for more details perfect resolve the Perfect Analogy creative Creepshow there's more than one of your cell so bad okay I would like to see this belt thank you very much the ultimate make you short story award by the way the fact that we actually did this was nuts and I would like to say on behalf of me one of the three non-winners I want say losers of the sober October fitness challenge Joe Rogan much like Jesus before him where there was nothing and then there was winning Joe Rogan you have achieved champion of silver October physical challenge

<timemark seconds="9231" />

this belt sign you are the champion of sober October I just want to stay for the record I was most impressed by you and then if you have been exercising as long as I I probably would have died trying to defeat you

<timemark seconds="9247" />

great job. Yes sir I do not pressed come on over it's already on I'll just say this I was Joe you showed us definitely what time it was second place and re you definitely got that so congratulations to you re but Joe you're better I hear you're in better shape than the three I think that how to factor that was certainly a part of it how much energy get put out where I put it in the man will work their ass off but it's all about trt or not even hahaha hahaha they have chemicals know you had doctors tell you that on it a hundred percent yeah I've had several

<timemark seconds="9303" />

particular at this is hurting like point you cross over as a person where you go how much time do I have left that 40 years left at 50 years wait what did you have first have that thought I mean I know you can have that many times it looks like when you took it seriously

<timemark seconds="9322" />

thirtysomething when I was in my thirties I would see my body not responding as well and also where is this going those when I really started thinking about it because I started seeing like I was working out really hard and as a boxing fan I always knew what a really good boxer got in there 30 days you have to keep an eye on them sour instantly they might get knocked out all the sudden and they couldn't take a punch anymore there's this guy named Doug DeWitt cuz like this badass bit away he just could take a punch like nobody else man was crazy I just got to just bang on the chin and people are freaking out like how does this guy take punches like this and then one day you couldn't take it anymore

<timemark seconds="9370" />

is it was a cumulative effect of all the punches landed but it was also age like almost all of the great Champions they get into the 30s and they just fall they start to slide where you freaked out I mean at the I don't know what how much how much did you question hormone replacement or anything like that like did you freak out about the thought of it or do smart people who study that think like what do they think said they were all how was it is a bunch of things you can do this is like and we talked about this word talking about

<timemark seconds="9405" />

if you got a good doctor they're not going to just put you on any kind of hormone replacement first right first thing they're going to do is exercise you going to check your blood to get a check your vitamin levels going to ask you what you eat how much do you sleep and how stressful is your life going to try to sort things out that way first that way your body is Adam or Optimum level in for a lot of people that's all they need they just need more sleep less sugar you know less processed foods you know do a little weight lifting do some squats and deadlifts things that boost your testosterone and maybe it was 34 we just tired after work and you can take that shit back in the gear cut out the milkshakes and all the bullshit I could probably kick it into gear like 49 50 51 57 and they're just fucking tired they're just tired and they and there's here's your aunt

<timemark seconds="9465" />

you can keep being tired or you can get your testosterone replaced and you're not as tired anymore you feel like a person feel like an actual person not like a decaying person cuz it's a lot of what makes you feel like a decaying printer is a body's lack of production of hormones and this is what's really important

<timemark seconds="9487" />

beat they think this is the case with a lot of people that have had head injuries they think this is one of those it's a key factor in depression for people that have been in car accidents people have been beat up people that have been had a lot of head injuries your body stops producing a lot of your hormones correctly cuz your pituitary gland gets damaged

<timemark seconds="9507" />

so for all those Reasons I'm at a certain point in time when it's 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 you got a one accept your mortality and to accept the idea that there are certain things that have been discovered scientifically that can enhance the time that you have left so you either you either like dive into them and listen to science yep in in an experiment trying to figure out what works best for you or you don't that's up to you this month was a real introspection into that like watching I literally was like I was like man

<timemark seconds="9546" />

having my lifestyle there's a lot of things I can fix before I added things you know if you know what I mean I get off blood pressure medicine drink last witch

<timemark seconds="9559" />

a really ethical doctor would go to that immediately that would be the first time they would go to it would say you got to just fix that because you listen you going to fucking Marathon mad that it's not like you're a loser girl you're fucking guy with an iron will you figured out a way to run a marathon when was very little training you know and then you did what is that stupid Spartan Race thing that should say stupid ridiculous of the Spartan Race is run around throwing fucking sandbags and shit like what you doing set a goal and I do go I got that coming up I think it helps me I'm not the kind of person that you just kind of float in the water and not know what I'm doing I think it helps everybody would just unnerved by the expectations of any kind of challenges that we subscribe to we just decide okay we're all going to agree the whole month of October we're just going to go crazy and do cardio 5 hours a fucking day and try to kill

<timemark seconds="9619" />

each other I don't care right now so much pain but what's more important is understanding how different Everything feels when you work out for 4 hours or whatever it was the average day if you looked at the whole month I probably worked out for hours every Jesus there was there was quite a few three hour sessions called you three hour sessions at night you did a lot of Weights also just to get much to do but gave you like fucking tons of time for me it wasn't even that is like I just have to mix it up or I'll go crazy

<timemark seconds="9679" />

yeah there were times at the end of the work out to where I be like I don't care if it's something I want to do fucking something else wanted you to wait it was a thing where I was in this weird high State this weird post long workout High State I just wanted to keep it going I just wanted to keep like following and relaxing while I was like lifting weights and doing like kettlebell swings and she said I just wanted to do something else you want to do chin-ups I want to do something was just moving my body almost as if I was pulling it down after all that all that exercise those bananas man after it was over I was like what the fuck happened would we do was like we got we got possessed by a wizard spell sudden

<timemark seconds="9726" />

we we we hit the 0.1% of all the people using this fucking thing I went down to that fucking Jim and I was like I want to sign up for whatever goes with here are things like and you can start working out right now so

<timemark seconds="9739" />

log me in Harvey me too that's it is that for middle-aged comedians 03813 s 0.1% I'm obese according to all the 0.1% diculous metrics without his nuts that we worked hard all the time say they were going to double me that's all I needed was like an idiot this is do you want to talk on the phone so there was a

<timemark seconds="9787" />

it's it's just it's a guarantee you it's on my Instagram it helped me to have you around yeah. 602 to me and Bert when he got sick was like okay cool he's done we both said something about seven hundred and they were like hey we talked that they were like looks like toms out pretty much we're like look like toms out cuz I got school so we're not going to last that was a big fear cellulite yeah I'm still try to beat you there I'm like yeah man good luck to you know if I can do it and it was just like oh okay we're still going to go on it still get along with a bucket challenge compliments than anything in this because Ari shaffir that you really change my perspective of working out like I'm going the way I go if I get to spin class and they are all in your feelings I go RV still out right now but that's the way your brain works it different man

<timemark seconds="9847" />

to get my fucking feet around each other the way a person's brain works

<timemark seconds="9853" />

yeah I just never do it normally tell you the reason why I knew you were dead last for short workouts for me I need two things were going on one Tom had been exercising a regular basis and even though he might have carried a little bit of body fat he's actually a fit strong guy with a strong mind I also knew that already swept me one time that mother fucker I was on top of him I was a brown about he's a white belt in a while ago I thought it was over already tried to kill me with his bare hands who's trying to kill me was trying to choke my neck can I just say I know re now that we've done this at your award ourselves yea

<timemark seconds="9914" />

I say why don't we do something it would be fun I love this idea already and they're all of us I know what it is until someone dies no I mean it's World War going to Vegas at a boxing fight would be fun yeah okay would be the most fun decrease the level of happiness I have in my life or metric show you what year would you be if it was a bird dying Kris the levels that are you can't you can't deny that you are very proud of yourself for your your performance this month because in my opinion this is I'm being a hundred percent of jective your your performance was the most impressive a surprise she has my whole life when I saw you just all the sudden thank you I appreciate that one day

<timemark seconds="9974" />

baccarat caught right up and I was like I'll fuck I was ready to Coast Marathon one time where a guy went the wrong way was in the lead or neck-and-neck with the guy went the wrong way and we had this ignore the last like three hundred and he had to come all the way back and I'll try to catch up but that waste of space that late and he starts print a nice picture right. The other guy who is already in first place cuz you fucking duct out deep yeah and when you started when I'm done I could do this pretty hard to stand where you come from okay what did I see Florida

<timemark seconds="10027" />

yes kickboxing let's go see kickboxing that what you wanted to say that's what you were leaning towards can you go to Chiang Mai Thailand Eileen yes and we going to see some kickboxing we can have cigars we can go to kickboxing fights a few days and no time like the chicken and some Thai food stay out of Bangkok Thailand we are in the back if you don't want to go see some fights have cigars and some Chang beer

<timemark seconds="10081" />

I really do like Monty Surf City surf surf travel what is that do you think you'll be good at it so he doesn't get it is when I first start doing yoga I was amazed at how shity I was at a yeah I was surprised I didn't think I would be getting it and I was where was this a 50 each other's piss wants to drink your piss

<timemark seconds="10141" />

is going to try I think he I mean you're obviously set to win this thing but I think Tom's going to sneak up he's playing it down you lose his wrist yesterday oh that's nothing just the calories you burn the day a thousand Tom's Tom sneaky gorillas Albert ran a marathon he did run a marathon you ran a marathon yesterday I worked out for 3 hours and 20 minutes I'm trying to I'm trying to I'm trying to break Bert will that's what I'm really trying to do this shit mother fucker workout twice a day like that I'll try to give you a fucking heart attack

<timemark seconds="10198" />

hahaha he's going to keep it up with weight loss challenge Tom stayed steady and Tom one in the end and one there bird tried he tried to Sprint towards the end it was too little too late and Tom was talking shit fuck off to the very end and you try to catch up it's going to be too late and he was right

<timemark seconds="10229" />

I don't know if birds will can be broken has it been broken before it's not his will it's the discipline aspect see when you're dealing with an entire month 31 days of having to get after it so how often do you get after it normally see that's the thing the difference between me and Bert is I workout almost everyday already so for me it's just like those days off don't exist anymore so what I've decided to do on my days off just do shit that I wouldn't normally do so I'll do the elliptical machine for 2 hours or I'll do something else I just I'll do something else but the whole time I'm thinking I'm going to break Bert I'm going to break my heart

<timemark seconds="10274" />

who told you about who you think about your family trying to get past the angry you think of Burt right now you're breaking his will

<timemark seconds="10296" />

mrs. sew in

<timemark seconds="10298" />

you're right you already work out a lot you're extremely healthy guy but you're not going to take it you're excited can see the excitement on all of you to take this to just an excruciating level because if it gets obsessive and it gets fun like you could work but that's the thing I'm excited to talk to you at the beginning of this when you're still pumped up about it and it's like you get a high from working out for 3 and 1/2 hours a day 17 days from now I'm going to be a beating man you're right that's not going to be a fun day for you who knows you know did you ever see there's a really nice bra off its become full but how do you feel how do you say cellarius man to break you

<timemark seconds="10358" />

it was fun it was fun and scary but I didn't think that it would go where it went in terms of like my how much time every day I was working out I never thought I would really get to that it was crazy I thought in the beginning we would all just have some fun workout an hour a day and then see who's truth number was higher but it will take everybody is the last week's going to Sprint right of course I thought that was going to happen when you made that video and I was like to video chat on my dog know it was another one before that way I thought I talked to rugged here and he was like fucking bird he's got to come in last

<timemark seconds="10418" />

you know you know for a fact that I made those videos I love right I understand but I didn't listen I believe that right now but it doesn't help me to believe that back then you don't got to be angry say something like that even if you don't mean it you said it and I don't have to get mad at you but I have to at least acknowledge there's a transference of energy right now I don't want to call it anger besides glue you don't ever fucking win this then there's no way we're going to go are you realize this is the difference that's not forget about that this is a difference between High performers for sure we were done pretty quickly I knew we were done pretty quickly we were John I knew that when he was saying

<timemark seconds="10478" />

even though I understand 100% understood what he was his joke does I'm going to double up your like that in a competitive I'm trying to do your regular workout and see if you can still beat us I'm like yeah yeah but not negative not not like you're like me really say I'm going to double everything Joe does Mike gave him the way you gave me a thought in my head that you going to try to do that

<timemark seconds="10520" />

yes daughter his daughter is not calling the Cable Guy Daddy because he's been gone so long working out she has no memory of him because you had to say I'm going to W T I knew that I don't need to know if you're being honest that's not necessary for me all I need to know I push that aside I need to know that you think that you were going to do that you think you would you even though you really know that he doesn't think he can do that a hundred percent I don't talk to him blinders on

<timemark seconds="10556" />

I'm going to turn around to go to the darkness can I just say this that we all use Bert as a motivation like I don't want him to beat me yeah but but fucking lost in this you got to understand I got real real serious anxiety when you got sick at know when I realize I could never recover if I got worse I'd be like I'm super sorry I would but whatever it is I was getting better and I thought I might lose you. Got real anxiety about yeah I got super nervous yeah but what kills me is that what you put a video I was out what it was or what was early it was like where do I put the belt

<timemark seconds="10616" />

of course I did not enter this contest to lose I didn't think I'm coming up roses fake body that now or before I don't know

and we're both like yeah I don't think we are either one of us fully trust each other out there on the other hand that's one reason but but it would have been like I'll just drink the whole time and then be like we never even started that it would be funny if I'd ever be 1 Franc coming my way to yoga class you like let's get blood test for you yeah yeah yeah you freaked out. Trust us somebody said wait did you have to get rid of it isn't even know if we said this last year but I had since I told him that I ran into him the night before the next day we're going to 15th class my phone reason is Joe and he goes are you in a white Lamborghini yeah and he was gay right in front of me since you told me you got a Lamborghini I assume that this

<timemark seconds="11,845" />

so then I pulled in here look for a place to park and I was like he's like nobody's going to fuck with this thing man was like a day after I had told Bert that it was a joke he called me he goes I did look at motorcycles cycle because I thought you got a treat I'm still like that I want to trade to I want to do I treat I want to treat that was it you like I want to treat you

<timemark seconds="11,883" />

<timemark seconds="11,943" />

the next year same thing should be I don't know. You know I don't want anyone win you win

<timemark seconds="11,951" />

the belt is pretty solid so I'm just saying that I'm saying this we should do something to celebrate and I'm just saying winning and losing for someone who came in second number one in trucks

<timemark seconds="11,964" />

I would say

<timemark seconds="11,968" />

non Asterix yeah I do I do testosterone

<timemark seconds="11,976" />

I would say I should have a full Jose Canseco Wikipedia say that my vote should carry some extra weight and I'm saying but it's really like to go to Chiang Mai Thailand watch some fucking kickbox and Fidelity of the part where you would all enjoy your type of thing also tell sure

<timemark seconds="12,001" />

No no no I will drink it drink it drink kombucha pissed but wait wait no I'm not I'm not drinking piss

<timemark seconds="12,061" />

I lost me and then I don't know what that will be but it should be a street you don't have a room or we can get a giant round trip tickets and 10 for fans that listen and then you buy those about the dog if we do we do Madison Square Garden New York

<timemark seconds="12,098" />

this private jet aesthetic is troubling you guys are so rash you're such a fucking horrible wasteful thing to get

<timemark seconds="12,106" />

what what what

<timemark seconds="12,108" />

Madison Square Garden I'll pay for the property tax rate in sun while taking over the proper tip to give us I'll meet I'll meet you guys at JFK just the three of us how surprising was this month hardcore for me it was very very surprising I can't be surprising to you though we're went it went so competitive they got so crazy but it was still like I could maybe catch him if you stop there when you wanted a hunting trip when you said I'm not going to work out for next 5 days we were all like oh we got a chance to pass him and then when you worked at all that's over fucked but like it was surprising that we kept fighting the whole way now that was one time that I went to Vegas for the UFC I took 3 days off and I came back and I was in last place I was like whoa and then Bert you help me there too cuz you tweeted that tweet

<timemark seconds="12,168" />

the last place and you even posted the numbers on Instagram and I was like okay so that really motivated motivated by everything that can be a motivator I don't let something not motivate me why would I do that so if you say in Spanish oh okay okay Eddie expert I never hear what you say and say well it's a great guy and you know I know he's just joking around I can do that later that doesn't help me right now right now helping me you tell me that you're going to beat me and I'm like oh yeah that's okay here we go I did a cruise at the beginning of this month with Bobby Kelly and I told him about the whole thing started I'm looking for the first time and I said yeah Rogan's in it I'm taunting them

<timemark seconds="12,228" />

Bobby goes why would you ever do that I go snowman and he goes no I don't think you know Joe I don't know I definitely know Joe you never taught him and then happened to the cruise I was like I think I fucked up man you told you he told you the stupid dude

<timemark seconds="12,250" />

what is a good motto it was a good model 175 in like 10 years I'm in Lexington California from Boyz II yeah way back before UFC before I ever did UFC commentary I did, we can do it you're the only one I know you don't seem like you would go to a place I would go for a short-term trip Monday through Friday

<timemark seconds="12,310" />

how long you you guys thinking answer for in a whole month is it for a competition next year and let's find out how long it is it sounds respectful a big numbers right now but I'm thinking 4 days never have been scared of sharks. That's why we can all go and surf together like we did with the hot yoga but we're all try to catch better waves monsters are real we would have to enlist and Kelly Slater's surf camp for whatever they got this we got this I like that you guys are idiots I can spend 5 days on this Earth

<timemark seconds="12,365" />

750 be honest I like putting it aside every October get off social media for the stupid we all just I just got to sell tickets for a body shots World Tour if you have anything you have to post about something you sent it to some sort of a manager can say hey send this tomorrow or sun is tell you as soon as you can if its after 10 p.m. that wait till tomorrow it's a good move and then you don't check it

<timemark seconds="12,413" />

you know I think it's not just a good move for us it's a good move for everybody like you should have to process cuz if you don't you won't process correctly see you be dealing with a bunch of information at something to get some of it you'll get right and something you'll get wrong but you never know what the real balances does too much of it is coming at you all the time all the time I can stop and think for a second you love it this is your wheelhouse same thing to be argued about podcasting people go away were talking too much we should be talking this much but it's something that are fans dig it. It should get your mind you start getting angry at 7 no one else who cares about all the comments don't look at lights dont looking at it but I guess what they that I would

<timemark seconds="12,473" />

people dig it to not to walk away from it I my opinion and I know I think it's no need to walk away I think I seen more like breaks take a break if you guys could hold a deal with a month off of all that shit you more than anybody and then you and then you up just like not being on that not letting it affect your opinion just walk outside and view the world for what it is Vermont it wouldn't kill you know I agree but I could get your business shit part done just by email as I post this for me and then never looking at it I don't know I don't argue against it I'm like you could do that I know I definitely could not and I don't want to like it's different I dude I dig I dig listening to you talk to Kelly Slater I thought that gives me joy podcast know know know how would I know Joe had Kelly Slater on social media but I would say probably best way to go

<timemark seconds="12,533" />

yeah I can get off all social media from month that would help you a lot I thought that you guys cheating or you really didn't like always thought that or even this month I was like you know what the worst case scenario would be somebody to be holding back where they weren't releasing information I had already prepared for that you got so far I wanted to save up like 7 days I couldn't trust that my eyes don't think it's in 13 hours one time I think you're looking at social media in a bad way

<timemark seconds="12,572" />

overall it shifts your dues is a negative there are some problem. Do what you need to do is a shift at and go like what are my positives order my negatives yeah it's the same as a podcast man there's no difference in Instagram in a podcast there's no difference why because it's information man is sharing cool shell but it's what you're looking at but I feel like sometimes you haven't been the fan that may be outside or has the person listen this right now goes to. Like when you do Instagram Instagram you did about you eating drugs and smoking and drinking made me giggle

<timemark seconds="12,609" />

I don't have to be there looking at the responses admitted by middle of the impulse to look at the responses and 10 gauge probably kill yourself and they said it hundred sixty-eight lights a lot of lights for a comment and then he said some people like how dare you you don't know that guy he's like how you just I'll just bring it down to the responses on fucking Instagram dude that what did that whole it's that that whole thing but I do not have people just block people yeah you don't just like just yet you never mind out there they just don't they don't feel good and they want you to feel shity to even if they're right about some things the way they address it is what the problem is

<timemark seconds="12,669" />

starting out an oozing anger in disproportionate amount and it affects everybody around them and it affects all of us the others that and is also said wake my kids up before I check my internet or whatever but it's like I'm spending on it was I too much it might do you good to see what it's like for a month off it and I like I think you should have a lot of time in my day its overall positive to do at the way you're describing I do think that it definitely for sure plays a part in our business that you needed for certain things but like you could have the thing where you going to send somebody is there a way around that I don't know there's some truth to that but then there's also people that make your life happier there's a lot of really hilarious shit online

<timemark seconds="12,729" />

I like watching his life like I'm just Cam Newton man he does running videos next to the car and I go I got to get out there do something there's me and Cameron Hayes or Cam Newton. Damn it man you don't like what they're saying Bert Kreischer Hammerman shout out to Cam Newton

<timemark seconds="12,766" />

I can't believe we did this much working out you guys that's fucking nuts trying to talk to you now and think about how much more weight would seriously be going out because he doesn't work as it could be mine by Sara Bareilles you think good tap out someone first and I have no training has the most training and you could do something to me but if I could stop you from doing that I would for sure but you understand what's happening probably offend people

<timemark seconds="12,818" />

exactly dude next year I don't know I'm waiting in my opinion can I just cut the surf contest a nap we should do it 6 months from now because you know Kelly said I can get this lined up and the weather will be perfect when we suck so hard we never served once he would know what any is Ulysses doing this from Tampa Florida interest in this whatsoever on top of this also MMA UFC Rules fight again sorry

<timemark seconds="12,878" />

how did God rise out okay here's the problem you can choke each other one choke each other the problem hitting is that shit is permanent the damage is real this is me when you're in your 40s you don't want to be getting punched in the face or one of your best friends and noxon crushes olimpiada how do you trap a real shot each other on 646 for real for real for real for real age Wikipedia

<timemark seconds="13,048" />

I know but you can throw in 10 lb essentially to what we waiting at okay as our real weight you know soon as I hear something we did last year or the year before that would this Challenge and with this one we didn't really take into account our own personal health we could do it but I had Phantom pains in my kidneys I was worried on this one the last day like the last few days I did like some of the range of 535 points you were worried about me dropping you a hundred percent I love that and even if you couldn't think about that same way I really thought it was asking trying to double me same feeling like I can't believe you really thought I don't care I don't care if it's Rita but I don't care if it's real it's just you said it

<timemark seconds="13,109" />

so you made it was not even if you don't believe it doesn't matter it doesn't help me to think that you don't believe I would love to help your meeting right now but I believe it it helps me to think that you're trying to double my score and Mike we're going to the darklands yeah going dark Bert Kreischer but as your question you're the only gained a few pounds on top of that after I stayed almost I think I'm not sure. I know it's been out the way I said what I said was what I said was that we probably gained 10 pounds back from the water cut into 16 will put me at 226 I said I probably gained a few pounds on top of it

<timemark seconds="13,777" />

yeah unfortunately

<timemark seconds="13,785" />

not so heavy so if you just get the chill out right do you think there was any point during the month we had a pace that you think you could have kept up where you been like you know hitting like it was 500. days like day after day after day after me what we already had planned for the month yeah you know if you had that you had that screws I had this hunting trip which fortunately and did fairly early but that if you were just going somewhere if you had something where they had to go for 14 days and you couldn't get a workout in and you are fucked up I had just stayed home that whole trip it would have been very different contest

<timemark seconds="13,845" />

she sick working out so you will just probably Kelly wow sometimes I did not work out but scars and so then when I got back to Tampa for like 1 day to work out dude I was like I was coughing up I worked out after I came home supposed to guard change went to work out or different people so BS on You by Dean Koontz

<timemark seconds="13,895" />

yes sir I got the Kelly how did this how we did it we did it cuz we didn't plan on doing it we did not have this idea that we were like what it's like yeah I wear a heart rate monitor and it's a fitness app where all like okay we were just looking for something to do some quantifiable going to be yoga again right before I remember that it was. I think it was lovely I would have done it was the 4th and all you guys were mad at me I'm just so mad I was on the road

<timemark seconds="13,932" />

how much are the red zone are you fucking killing these fucking guys are so pissed about anybody find you and I didn't read into the stupid shit at all so when I got the app and I put the heart rate monitor on my well we'll just run to the death was like we're just going to run into the 90s like you see how I got you I thought you were up 80% of your max 97 would probably like oh yeah there's ice on the roads like buying people to go to Sears with interesting about that actually changed some of my opinions on training because I've never done that

<timemark seconds="13,992" />

why didn't just do a lot of like really like to go all-out I did as little I even slow down the pace that I run up the hills but when I would get on the heavy bag when I would do kickboxing I had way more endurance like way more endurance it was interesting I was like this is crazy but this is all I have and I've been I maybe did over the course of the entire month maybe 10 kickboxing workout but by the end of the month the kickboxing endurance is gotten way higher running and from doing the elliptical machine a rowing machine and doing all that other shit all the other shit just you know it's not as exciting to do but if you do it and ramps up everything around now running hills you know you got we got to keep going because I want to try so we got to keep going right to keep going down a little bit

<timemark seconds="14,052" />

what to write when you start being like Oh I don't want to chicken out cuz going to fuck over when I just said we should all talk about this and maybe we should have a coach come on and talk to us about if we decide to do this again what are nutritional requirements cuz I had one work at the 4700 calories

<timemark seconds="14,071" />

yeah okay that's an insane amount of food you know why I never got them like Precious as people like that work on people's like legit workouts you can do you know I mean not like this the best thing for my real life I'm going to do it twice a week what can I really do what do I got to eat a little bit more often that can help me instead of like an all this diet generally forgot my stress level what if I told you you could do it I could do it what time is it what is it where we at now you can do I can bring this broken broken what's the best what's the time in on that a thousand and the day. There you suck my dick like you mean it but if you don't get there just like you don't care at all.

<timemark seconds="14,133" />

what you can do it now or you can do what you did before - 5 days hundred percent how about the three days off. I took 4 days off I took 3 in another day but you don't think right now that if we get one day next week one day I'm going to Europe that's crazy most points in Rogan rest so you could have got 260 more points but the 6:40 something something like that on a one-off I didn't never sit down cuz I had some days where I def thought there's like six foot

<timemark seconds="14,192" />

it's always fun but here's what we should really think about we definitely got her all of ourselves into a really really good level of fitness and 12 Mi you ran 15 miles then you rode 5km got seven hundred fucking points in a deck we went crazy boys went crazy weird she seems like some very bizarre level of a performance over the month in comparison to the average person that wears these things it's very weird so it's not that we should Pat each other on the back but it is we should look at what we did and go what happen if it is possible you should think it happened and I feel great

<timemark seconds="14,252" />

it looks so. It's exactly right literally a hundred percent Outreach Rose pubis standing I thought I really thought I was like this is a movie montage to watch his like he's really buying into it I was like he was changing his life you know I don't for the perfect cuz it's a perfect pull the ABS they never look at it as much as they surf camp drum beat them so bad

<timemark seconds="14,312" />

people's butt is a Mexican food that's it but here's a thing we pull it off like we really wanted something good is never expected to know for sure or not you crush them here's was crazy if you think about the points for points a minute is like Hustlers you see that Talent you're in the tent with Tali they get they send you an e-mail of your monthly tally I didn't look all the info I will give you perspective on the calories you're burnt yes

<timemark seconds="14,366" />

yeah what's interesting is we didn't anticipate it did not anticipate does I thought it would be like an hour or so so so 3000 psi what happened so it says for the whole month first watch shows me the whole year leading up to October and then it says the 9538 maps which is the measurement write 3726 in how many hours is it October from the hours at 60 60 hours average effort 70% for the whole month calories burned for the month 47800 an average heart rate + 131 BPM we are cuz there's a guy who went he swam around the UK

<timemark seconds="14,426" />

pull that up this guy fucking swam around the UK he swam he burned a half a million calories does guys crazy tongue was falling apart and this guy swam around the UK hundred and fifty Seven Days swim in 12 hours a day in 2 weeks we can't talk son he did good man barnwell's he did 4098 minutes of working out 66% effort bird $46,258 average heart rate hundred twenty

<timemark seconds="14,486" />

yeah when you got this expenditure is like way more severe 200 yeah I'm different 2 when you got into running like legit running so I would run 10 miles at night and I would only get 200 points for it I just get up in the middle of the night and I know yet because my heart rate wouldn't get over 130 thank God for 24-Hour gyms or your own weight lifting think you were killing psychos and like a weirdo every piece of equipment you get or if you have your own place obviously every time is your own place I'm a person's working out 3 this morning took a genius could be can't handle people

<timemark seconds="14,539" />

could be 6 Simone said he works at Gold's Gym for a while and you just see that he had a difference between 4 a.m. till like 6 a.m. between the Tweakers to slowly become like the winners we got like a ride to work work out yeah it was such a quick shift of like type of person coming in are we going to dinner

<timemark seconds="14,558" />

we want tell people on the internet about ice cream with the person that I love the competitive event Friday I like you guys more even though I really likes you for I'm serious I feel like it makes me like you guys more because I'm like a rotary being on a team feels like a team thing and yeah I had that moment where I'm like I'm capable of more that I thought I was capable of which is like I'm saying it's encouraging and then it kind of sucks with you too

<timemark seconds="14,609" />

are you what did you learn I learned one that I actually am capable of working out I needed the competition to actually get to the gym and I haven't got there till October

<timemark seconds="14,625" />

I also learned how many people got in the ass it was not even working out and by the way my favorite spots is in one of these things like House of October going Danny Phantom walk by I just go go fuck yourself eat shit kill yourself that's how you say yeah all the time how you enjoy yourself and your wife it was the best time to play with it and I realize that I actually can work out a little bit maybe I should work out a little bit I did and that's awesome I do what I do remember also on the 30th II last day I was trying to get you get points yeah I was on a cell phone and he did not look like somebody I would think would say anything to me and he's like yeah buns I'm pulling for you

<timemark seconds="14,685" />

me and see what I'm doing sober October to know shit I did I didn't anticipate getting that crazy cuz I just didn't I thought it was just going to be us having fun we would work out like last year 15 yoga classes is not that extraordinary till the ladder for sure the latter part of the month right we all district team together at like the 28th what I learned something last year though honestly to carry over this year that I decided to do 9 year old classes in a row to finish off my session I had like a bunch of weeks I'd like a week plus later to go if I want to make it to the end of month to get the 15in and I started decided to do 9 in a row and when I realized somewhere around like number 7 in a row I was like oh you can just keep doing it but you think you need time off but you don't really need time off just need to keep doing

<timemark seconds="14,745" />

and maybe you'll slow down a little bit maybe I won't have as much energy but he just keep doing it your body eventually adapt but this is way more demand that this is what what would happen with this to so what I realized last year by doing 9 in a row but your body just sort of a dabs and then once I started doing like wrapping up the cardio sessions and I was like okay if I just decide to get off now I can get off now I can just stop now an hour and a half Salon you be like 5 hours like we did an hour and a half then we're almost there there were three and then we do an hour-and-a-half again two or four and a half the wrong also yeah keep going

<timemark seconds="14,791" />

this is what this is all about this is why psychos like Lance Armstrong win the Tour de France not just cuz steroids cuz he's a fucking psycho kind of a werewolf when he figures out a way to win daily workout right now like whatever Lance says today is for Mortar is my zones on that guy is a Super Hyper not just to go do it but I should go you need to go you need to leave your apartment your house and you can go over there I know you want to do this but you got to go do a nap for a couple hours that part was like one of the hardest parts or let you know what you learned

<timemark seconds="14,851" />

I learned that I have a lot more in me than I ever thought I had yeah I learned that Ari is a sneaky fuck think we got a lot more strength than I ever thought they were sandbag and you said I got angry lie I think you're really upset I was scared of you have with those black guys I was going to just sneak up on you I didn't think you really believe you're going to double back and never thought that was real hard so they didn't have to I heard the words and so I decided to believe them believe them did you think I was going to beat you you never what I never knew Tom of you me I'll meet you

<timemark seconds="14,905" />

no not not at all I thought you were sort of shape I thought it was a missed charge when the system and then we went on a hike together I was like oh fuck I was like oh yeah of course someone that's a hundred pounds lighter than me would be in better shape that makes sense. Thank you for the event but yes yes but my number one thing is that I need this camaraderie to better myself like when you get challenge by your friend and you have this fun fuckry that just happens every day should have put you into a place that's better for yourself my opinion it's also really fun for people listening I got a lot of people that came up to me and said man I wish I had friends like you guys because you guys are so silly and stupid you're both all of you rather or just like goofing each other constantly and everybody's laughing howling and it gives everybody that's listening to this is bizarre sense of camaraderie that's true

<timemark seconds="14,965" />

we were doing insane amount of exercise we're not a old train for like a second or third in the final scores yet where you going to try to kill her that's crazy and she probably never gets out of the Grange Providence supershape we just did a 1-month chaos run

<timemark seconds="15,016" />

may we all survive but I think we should be careful about this cuz they're there is there is there is really a potential damage your body doing stuff like this it's really fun for sure but there's a weird potential for like when you hear stuff like rhabdo you like what what happened to tell you about the actual for the positive or the negative that it's like just do it I need to go to the cramps I had unbelievable muscle cramps the last well so I took a lot more than I needed I took them with who I added Himalayan salt and water and one things that I realize when you add too much Himalayan salt water your body process is it like food so all that water comes right through your butthole like a runaway train

<timemark seconds="15,076" />

ocean water is 34 oz of water coming flying out of your ass hole at Mach 1 it's crazy dude your body when you drink salt with water together your body goes oh this is food what is this week get it out of here get it out who comes out like water was blown out for a lot of those work out the amount of time that all of us were pumping our legs it's crazy Jesus Christ doesn't make any sense all of us what about to do the most Preposterous might have been posterous in terms of a normal month of exercise 10 months I've never seen it

<timemark seconds="15,136" />

to a terrible terrible place to get to 11000 it was only because we were all sort of pushing each other words like fuck is going to be treated at least that one day I got one more day and be a die-hard show is beat Bert tell me what you and I talked about I was telling him on the 31st I was like fuck I got this I'm not just I just was the Tampa here I got the next day and night so I lost I didn't tell you guys I didn't know how was going to fax I was like all right cuz we had to cut off of 10 Eastern but just got to the hotel I checked then I go right to the gym and I was like man spin a fucking mother fucker and I got to work out right now I didn't know how I knew you were six seven hundred points ahead of me

<timemark seconds="15,196" />

I just started I was like I just I can't lose the bird right now I can't I can't and I had major anxiety like I would suck to lose that I had like crippling anxiety about it and I was like alright I just kept going and I had a few hundred points I was already at least I didn't know if you'd synced up so I was thinking it was a real worried if we do this ever again first of all we got to get blood checked if we if we are selling drugs no no no no no no no I mean rhabdo I mean people dying I really think we should do it with doctors because there was a point where I said I get the ender eyes does a phantom pains

<timemark seconds="15,256" />

that's probably why you call Joe I called and talked to him first I worked out in the morning by the way you talk to everyone in here with me I talk to you you just don't call me Landon went to the fucking gym actually talk to you and then you and then an hour after you I spoke to him and I was like I see that you I was started 300 ahead of them now if you don't work out he can catch you two and a half hours and I have tried didn't know and I was like what's up and I really believed him I was like I hear he was like chopping his I'm cooking right now at the house friends are over blah blah he's like I swear I'm done

<timemark seconds="15,316" />

I was like all right man and I just hung up and I was like I got to go for at least another 15. And I go I've got friends over I had to go spend the day with George over their thing I don't have time to work out and I'm not going to do it now I'm ready to get fucked up at midnight and was not going to go another 500 forecast minutes are I was like can you please just tell me so I can actually take this dancing when I'm on you know what I heard it was very nice I got back from spin class George was at school and texted me she goes hey I need you to do the daddy luncheon set up at 9 and it was like 8 and I looked at me and I was like I'm done I can't I got really angry she was honey you lost during your cash

<timemark seconds="15,376" />

about it I want it I give it really hard today I can definitely it's you just like all of it because Dad and I get my head straight well maybe we should consider this maybe we should think that this competition is more of a time constraint issue in like how much time you have time for it right yeah I want to be able to do this my friends right now I can't go with working out yeah I know Joe's got two young kids and I will go he's really in 5 hours I go fuck it and I would I would make up a schedule where I could work out for at least 4 hours before I had to be at the podcast you can come in here and do it till 20 minutes before shower and be ready

<timemark seconds="15,436" />

play I'm out of the house at 707 I'm coming to the gym or I'm going to you no work out of my yard or I'm going to run the hills a lot run the hills a lot I got a few different route so I go this way more severe than beginning starts out like with a real heavy pitch it's a real steep steep steep beginning and that it gets harder and harder than the end of it you're running more of a downward slope kind of cool down so that I can say was yeah it's it's hard man what about running hills that are I really think it's like it's a survival thing so if you want to get away what you got to do what you got to run I got to get your body out of you can't get your body out of there by mother fucker it's a scary thing running those Hills Ron Ron hey do you have a place that you could

<timemark seconds="15,494" />

what am I pretty hammered now just saying run run sorry have a place we can what by elk I give you some you know know know know know me like I was a whole month this whole month I would look at your meals and I go to start eating melt elk okay but I can go buy it you know you can buy some of it from New Zealand that they'll sell it from New Zealand but you can't buy North American game animals in North America that I couldn't find it for save my life yeah that's cuz it's not for sale commercial that you could date they raise it in

<timemark seconds="15,538" />

hey what's up brother what's up in particular you know New Zealand giant collection of I forgot this one thing sober October you said before I thought about a couple times throughout the month the the your inner bitch thing conquer your inner bitch that day to quit but everyday here's the thing I didn't even consider it in your voice every day I was like these these three fucking cock suckers are doing it so I was doing her a lot of quite a lot of the month I was doing two-a-days you want me to have no crazy crazy when you have for the interesting to me was like when you have friends involved

<timemark seconds="15,590" />

do the consideration of even let's just lay here and chill wasn't even a consideration we can scream into the night I want to get a bottle of cab I want a Pinot Noir let's get like bone-in rib eyes were going to do it up tonight we are all important as human beings we got to a very good state of fitness and we should really keep it just really keep it if you don't have to do this crazy stupid fucking thing we compare art our points and we have a prize in the belt every month but tell me about if we stayed on the system or another system know to find out what's the best way to Hannibal and good enough for you and here's the thing that's really important to help other people too

<timemark seconds="15,650" />

the people go I got one p r e I want to beat you I want to be tall and be first I want to beat these guys I want to be a part of this and then what they'll do as long as we emphasize this idea of don't fucking kill yourself cuz I don't know how close we got to killing ourselves but we definitely got close to Breaking are so I don't know what was going on see here's the thing like it was robbed all that shit super serious but my urine was starting to turn darker as they say on the bottle trying to open until you sissy to my workout sessions they were confusing their confusing it was like Mike Mike Mike whole brain it shifted over to this weird combat mode is very strange I believe it was pretty strange man for all of us I think I think all of us when I looked at 479 points in a day

<timemark seconds="15,710" />

Push It This Is War Reservoir it was going for it I was like wait I think I could actually do this dude you're really going to put that strap on her there was no question that she had no question about keeping it quiet I trusted her so when what would your plan to bend just give it to her all the time all the time she runs 13 miles a day that's what I run a year later I would have kept it even if you would want I want and you guys had to pay for some fucking fancy trip you guys all decide on that in the winter since I would have taken July gladly

<timemark seconds="15,770" />

separate account for yourself account for myself and I try to beat you on my own original ball super humble about it

<timemark seconds="15,781" />

but came into the great effort how about we try and just fucking show your stats I'm into the surfing they serve at all and I've had two Surfers on the month really had Kelly Slater and Shane Dorian on just a couple hours in the beach and they push you and you start actually surfing it's fucking fun as you did what's his name what's the big wave surfer in Maui in the water tour

<timemark seconds="15,841" />

Mother Nature on a fucking phone powered off of helicopters on to the way really fucking powerful big wave Surfers I want him on your podcast Batman maybe a great one volleyball

<timemark seconds="15,867" />

say about surfing to as you also monsters in the mix of sharks in the podcast he was like a little but I think he emphasized that big of a deal that they were there that they are all there that all the time but he kept dodging it and I was like man it is one of those weird things were you look at a guy that spent that much time in the water and never had it like had to deal with it and then is friends have that's fucking insane man to charge her fucking imagine me you have no control in their world you're you're you're agreeing to being like a movement impaired entity in a struggling alien world but you can't figure you could barely get by for thrash in your arms and legs and a shock to just wiggle up at stop

<timemark seconds="15,927" />

take a big chunk out of your leg and you said I was in the water with a great white Open Water Open Water of them water when I was just looking down at them no nose in the water with it I was out of the cage and there's a great white it was it was all I know is that it was the only animal I move with that it move it that much intention but like think at any point in time like this could be how I go in the water with great whites couple times no no no no

<timemark seconds="15,976" />

fuck yeah they really are like that now would be a fucking killer video like we now all the shit I did before I talk to her she did it all do it now do it do it do it now instead of no I just do Santa probably stop driving until now until April 1st, are you International you going to bring International is going to the UK Scandinavia Australia New Zealand those dates haven't been released yet but man I am so happy and so excited, he's hurt and Tommy you got some dates I have some dates to yeah yeah I'm doing a bunch of dates Tom Segura.

<timemark seconds="16,100" />

230 each let's do it sent I'm in a really really fun month it was it made me really happy it was fun the camaraderie was appreciated it was exciting it was ridiculous he was fucking hard but it was also it was fun and it felt good and it ain't even though I was like you know this guy when he kills that God damn it was I still was like wow I can't believe what everybody is doing that everybody was pushing so hard I would have never went as hard as I did if it wasn't for you guys there's not a chance in hell not a chance in hell there's no way I would have gone that hard I've never done that hard in my life if you had to point any 31-day month in my life and you put out like how much effort I put forth

<timemark seconds="16,160" />

that's as crazy as probably I probably would have been a better fighter fight rain that hard back when I was computer fucking three non-athletes and one guy was running away from memory was father

<timemark seconds="16,173" />

do do do do we are fucking glad we showed human potential we show its potential we thought we were capable of we're capable of so much more now the question is whether or not we should continue to put out that kind of effort I say no but I do say that we reached a really healthy powerful level of Fitness we should definitely keep up some of it yeah we're going to try to do that I lay down I don't know each other right now right there.
