greatest heavyweight boxing champions of all time the Great and Powerful Lennox Lewis and his good friend and my good friend as well one of the best stand-up comics on the planet Earth Russell Peters so please welcome Russell Peters and Lennox Lewis

<timemark seconds="430" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="438" />

this time would live ladies and gentlemen we are alive with the Great and Powerful Russell Peters and one of the baddest motherfukers ever get into the ring Lennox Lewis don't mess with the best that's a fact that you got your walking around on this Earth one of the baddest motherfukers of all time. 500% sure you have your wits about you 100% you smooth and relaxed you know how did you do that I started out that way

<timemark seconds="474" />

it's like you know it. Apple don't fall too far from the tree type of thing I've always been that way Collective thinker soft-spoken I'm done what you don't know about me what you don't know about me when you do know about me you love me even more do you exercise at all anymore boxing wise do you get the bag and not hit the bag I'm more into like working out with the way it was like it was hard for me when I retired that was the worst part was the hardest just you know the saying okay eating more so I need to exercise, I dunno exercising but when I start exercising I'm training for a fight right to say to myself or let me try the soft things going to play tennis and all these different sports which I can play and that kind of helped me a lot better

<timemark seconds="534" />

done there done that kind of fat and that's what made me want to lose weight

<timemark seconds="549" />

people talking shit with our with our dear friend John Waite off yeah that's a fact that some strenuous shit you ever thought about doing Jiu-Jitsu likes he's scared of me he wanted a kickboxing all these different mediums and you know we're always practice with them where they kick in with her it's doing whatever play fighting all that stuff and say well you know how does he grow up against a karate guy house if you're up against a kickboxer house if you're up against the MMA guy

<timemark seconds="609" />

around like that you know it's like don't mess with me okay if you mess with me so I'm going to happen and then they don't really mess with my kind of carry myself like that cuz I'm so serious that sometimes they can sense the seriousness of it serious but still easy going so it's a reason to push you right silent but violent like that silent but violent it is an interesting video about about Fighters is that you're when you think of exercise you think of exercises you're preparing for a big violin event we're at your most people just don't want to be fat they want to look good they want to get in shape and you know it's a lot of people on Instagram that just working out really hard every day but there's no reason you had to read some of the reasons gone

<timemark seconds="661" />

now what how do I maintain the shape listen without you think of another reason to see me since I was a hundred 47 lb I know his parents big star now I seen in movies and commercials rescuing people mixtapes in the 90s he was already World Champ and I've been planted mixtape I just made it

<timemark seconds="721" />

yeah well you know everybody was making tapes back then on the streets going on you know that was a real shit so I didn't have that people don't know Russell's legit DJ reluctantly you know when you see him wrestle with people on TMZ you see that shit where they sing with the jewel thief trying to see what happened after the get it snack and then the other guy in front of them pull them down I couldn't get the neck could you tell us what happened I mean

<timemark seconds="780" />

okay cigarettes are looking at a ring right and that guy sitting down earlier had check to see if the door was open he went out and now he really thinks the door open so now he thinks he's just going to get up and walk away with this ring

<timemark seconds="798" />

his wife makes his little move

<timemark seconds="801" />

and then they lock the doors and I'm standing like what's going on and I'm like he takes a swing at my friend's father then I go now I try to get his neck and that guy pulls and me see there's a lot of opportunities at the neck they're so big strong the top players on an issue, give me the alarm to 7 get the I move dad moved add animation and then walk the rest are as soon as I lock the Army says he says okay okay okay okay that was my fredson paixao look up again

<timemark seconds="861" />

cousin is hiding

<timemark seconds="864" />

when he was trying to get out of whack his head against that wall oh no and he couldn't see her up that did the thief arrested New York City grab things and run away that's hilarious do you have to go to court or anything like that and then tell the cops come but the thing is like you could injure him if you enjoy him then they sue you believe it or not really being ridiculous

<timemark seconds="924" />

see if you have true so I didn't crack him one the one knee down and one leg up and I kicked that leg out so you both need it again how would you do things different question and I was you feel good about yourself and kind of run the whole thing three of mine a couple of times like you this could happen or what could happen if he had a gun or if you had a nice but I'm like if you had a gun I would have pulled it out right away

<timemark seconds="977" />

wow yeah surprise you with a gun

<timemark seconds="986" />

one of us would have got shot but if you probably got real urgent if you some reaching for something for the changed different things you could do like a practice karate if you want to do something different that's why I was asking about you did to you when your world heavyweight champion boxer after while what are the shit can I learn you know great Bruce Lee Van I love fighting movies and you know martial arts is always being a part of my life and I say that because if we fight I fought before I fought that fight I watch the martial art movie really like what's a Chuck Norris Bruce Lee that kind of ship Jackie Chan

<timemark seconds="1046" />

I like that just got me in that mental state like you know what I do this

<timemark seconds="1059" />

the only thing I think about that because you know like I said I was in the wrestling and in his wrestling when I was younger and boxing as well so I didn't know they could combine them to until I got older but you know my focus was more unboxing but you know if they get paid a lot of money I probably would have done it yeah that's how a lot of people feel I think I think it's like right now the money's not quite there it's not quite it's for some people at Conor McGregor or Ronda Rousey and but for the other folks is knock it's not enough to get a guy like Errol Spence to jump over you know and then I see a lot of us some boxers actually good at boxing actually just win the fight on boxing because they're so good with their hands but just have your lead leg out in MMA that's the problem sideways yeah we're up to get lit up and sideways even in the fight cuz I know that I stick that look out there for them to come, obviously you know

<timemark seconds="1119" />

easy to grab a leg but to me I don't think fighting should start that way anyway nobody when you start fighting usually sponges are thrown quick and last a couple seconds nobody really just goes for your legs and let State they say okay I'm going to go for his legs and taking down and I couldn't move into a fight and they gave me that look like this I don't know what I would do so and if it's a world heavyweight kickboxing champion they just keep the hands up and chew your legs up one or two shots your legs and it's a horrible feeling well you know what you guys look like you've accepted that I'm mad

<timemark seconds="1179" />

I don't think everybody's sticking in your leg and kickboxing Tom Erickson leg kicked out and he said he you know Janet oxy Solaris Eagles champ he goes it hurts so bad but I try to play it off champ eat a tattoo touch them would like a job to the body and Tom Erickson got a little cocky here is or here he bought when he was in like this transitionary. And they offered him a lot of my like right there I got leg kick by this guy and the guy Tom Erickson the thought is really more of a wrestler he kicked him twice and then Shannon he he actually broke it down for us on the podcast but he said his leg was hurting so bad he tried to go the guy into thinking that he could punch with them see they get hit again he's like oh Jesus

<timemark seconds="1239" />

to get hit with one of those things like that it's so crippling to your leg you don't know you're right because like I said you put Shannon to sleep to Erikson trying to box it up for some strange reason he got into this crazy idea of right they are both be got clipped and that's the one chill chill chill boxing kickboxing gloves no shoes well you know if you knew how to but I think he went into their thinking and I'll just crack them with a paunch and knock them out what you did you know he ate a couple of leg kicks but it's hilarious when you hear him break down he's how old do you know I'm under a hundred hundred hundred hundred but you can't be any more than like 4547 whole thank you very much thank you very much

<timemark seconds="1299" />

great guy you don't want to say thank you he's always look good but when you were like you you're one of those guys who did the smart you were tired and you just retired yes you know which is I respect so much we're just talking about Marvin Hagler the other day when Marvin Hagler retired take care of Buddy lost a controversial decision to Sugar Ray Leonard and he said the same thing and it just never came back is so rare that if either does that will you know what time it was disheartening like a motherfuker 4th boxing know he hated it was like I'm out through so much and it's like when they know when it's time that when a boxer says it's time to quit they know it's time because I've gone through so much and they realized that is a lot of hard work for me I've been boxing since I've been

<timemark seconds="1359" />

so you know in training hundreds of hours training hundreds of hours working out Reston working on technique Spa all these different things after a while you know you have to read you reach that high where you say okay that's enough and sometimes you know people managers and trainers and promoters they don't want to tell the boxer that's enough because that's how much been making money off of that box every time he steps in the ring so I made the decision he wanted to let me actually to go on wheeling yeah cuz I wanted to let you know Tyson was my main Nemesis and you know he's a boxer that I definitely wanted to fight before retiring and I didn't know if it was going to happen or not so I actually stuck around for a couple more years for that fight to happen because I didn't want throughout

<timemark seconds="1418" />

history people will be saying oh I want them to know someone and then after that after the Tyson fight you know Manny said listen this goes around us a new generation you can beat the guys from this generation and the guys from the Next Generation I'm like yeah that sounds good so we kind of talked me into doing that fight cuz I wasn't really going to go do that and then you know that was a year after Tyson and I didn't really want to box him straight away I wanted to block somebody else because the main Nemesis was Tyson and you know once I once I beat Tyson you know I could relax a little bit a relaxed for a year and then getting back into box in a box Crisco was my first fight which was a mistake to the fight 70 17 days notice

<timemark seconds="1468" />

at my worst I beat him at his best why did why was in such a short notice fight because I actually picked to fight then fight didn't want to fight me actually said know who was I supposed to be Johnson from he was doing him a favor listen to let me take the fight off in training for 2 years for this guy I'm ready and then we'll give you the first shot after I win that's what was promised him that you're weird style yeah he did and that's Thai kickboxing stuff coming in to play a little bit because he would throw a punch and lean back like this and it's the first time I've actually seen that style reach out with my right hand as far as I did I would never call them with that cut and it was up long right hand that caught him just at the end of my punch when he leaned back and you can lean back

<timemark seconds="1528" />

anymore that made his I cut yeah he was a very strange fighter in terms of his style just the way your hands are always down as a very weird way of moving very unorthodox because he was such a big guy with Luis Gonzalez to such an awkward way of moving the Hitman good with a right hand that I hold onto me hold and Muhammad Ali

<timemark seconds="1566" />

he said if you heard the call the good guy around the neck you can tell when he's going to move

<timemark seconds="1573" />

wow what he was he was good in the in the first few rounds

<timemark seconds="1578" />

after that first three rounds

<timemark seconds="1581" />

what people realize about this fight I wasn't fighting for 12 rounds I was fine to knock this guy out

<timemark seconds="1590" />

because you had it in your mind I had in mind this is the first time you ever seen me going forward in the flood guys bigger than me I'm coming forward and I'm throwing punches he's catching me but those were the early rounds although he's bigger than him when you look back on your career like do you have like a most satisfying yeah what is it awesome Rock and I was going to say that I was going to say the rematch first and then you know you could have beaten them you should have beaten them cuz that would bother you so much know you know what really bothers me is the fact that I gave him an opportunity I gave him a fight when I'm basically waiting for Tyson and I have to keep busy I'm looking down the list of who to fight he's number seven I realize that he's durable is not not one of these guys that got knocked out easy

<timemark seconds="1650" />

so I wanted to give my fans you know a proper fight box the best guy out there in that box of easy guy that's easy to get knocked out I don't want to go home in 2 rounds so and then another reason a lot of people don't know I went to Africa to fight because Muhammad Ali went to Africa a part in Africa so I wanted to do that wants to be I wanted to find out for you know I say I'm a world champion so I need to fight all around the world so that's what made me go to Africa the only thing about Africa is I didn't know that it was such a high altitude up there and for me to have a fight I should have got there a lot earlier but I was doing Ocean's 11 at that time I was at around half the time waiting for them to change the lights then go out and go up there for 2 minutes and then go back and sit there for another two hours while they change the light so we training it all of that was happening yeah I was trying but it wasn't like it was in the conditions of training you know I needed a bag I needed sparring partners

<timemark seconds="1710" />

up there a lot sooner you can just kind of how many thousand feet was it above sea level higher than big bear I didn't know that it was kind of weird because when I start working out I was like twin punches then I found myself going

<timemark seconds="1731" />

set to take two steps back on like no I'm not don't tell me this fight is going to be one of those fights where I have to take my time so I basically went out there taking my time I realized he's dealing with the same thing I'm dealing with although he was there a lot earlier but

<timemark seconds="1747" />

you know I have a couple things going wrong boxing at 4 in the morning they couldn't find a big enough for ring then they when they put the ring together it was like 18 by 19 so and then go to the punch to actually hit me I actually thought I was going to block it but it came around this side put my I put my hand up to block it but it came round hit me one of those things where a man through a terrific punch with my chin happened to be in the way of what is it like when that's over when you're sitting there and you know you lost but you know that under the right circumstances this guy is not at your level in fact you know my problem was solved before I got out of the rent I knew what I did wrong which was the greatest thing that ever happened to me is like

<timemark seconds="1799" />

another day he wouldn't throw a lucky punch like that it wouldn't hit me and he wouldn't have a ref that you know was on his side of it as well how's the traffic on the side when I say I'm the Champion at least give me a chance not the way to fight straight but I tell you that I see you know if that was the Refuge out straightaway landed the fact that Tyson got up and then won the remainder of the round that is crazy I am so frustrated that fights not happening again you know I'm looking at but heavyweight scene and I'm looking to obviously you

<timemark seconds="1851" />

Joshua Joshua from England and you know he had the opportunity to fight Deontay and didn't take it I'm like if that was me I would have took that chance because you never know what happens down the road likes what's happening now and you notes it to me is being put on the Shelf now he has to block somebody that nobody really wants him to boxes you fighting next baby baby I haven't seen too much of him I don't know too much about it but you know he's talks a good fight I knew you I know he weighed weighed over 300 pounds at one time is and you know now he's got an opportunity to fight the Joshua so he's taking full advantage of it like he should but you know

<timemark seconds="1896" />

I don't see anything in history to show me that he can beat Joshua in the movie is an excellent boxer we'll see after careful because Miller is going to try and twice as hard and if Joshua doesn't rain like he's fighting Deonte he's going to you may take it for granted make a mistake you can do that then it's nothing it's nothing that he's done on purpose is that it's like it's a mental thing he gave me a lot of trouble

<timemark seconds="1948" />

Linux boxes guy running for 12 rounds like literally the guy's head snapping back in the sky party punch and you see a guy just eating them like some people just are built weird they just can't take a shot know I learned. Coming up I learned that like you're some guys that have talked to the head or week to the body from guys are tough to the body weak To The Head and some guys just made out of rocks yeah it's almost home and I really think it's a physiological thing I think some guys can just take a shot but they just did just built better sometimes hit me on the chin for a couple minutes and it's like he does glint of my chin is like I ate a bunch of

<timemark seconds="2008" />

and when I look at tape of it is it because like a bunch of factors like how much you got hit in training how well you feel coming into the fight where you're at in your career and all of a sudden you step into the ring and it's a title fight and box you got the first could hit you get is going to concussion you because you haven't been getting those hits for that last 2 years now this man hit you with the two years and you getting used to it and you have you felt it and you've gotten over you need to get over that Hill is it a mental health it is a mental because even for me for me when I haven't fought for a while

<timemark seconds="2055" />

you know I go out there until I get hit once I get hit that wakes everything else like yo this is not supposed to go like that you're not supposed to hit me I'm supposed to hit you so I get so the hasim Rahman fight after it was over where you were either you were going to get a we're not going to get a rematch yes in fact we chased him to three courts around the world and that he didn't want to fight me and you know if I was in his position I wouldn't want to fight me either because you know I'm coming back for Revenge plus there's a big money fight out they were Tyson Bryant he sold so happened to say after the fight no more Lewis Tyson no more Lewis Tyson and he actually left South Africa without visiting Mandela like why you go African of is the Mandela I did I just want to get out of there

<timemark seconds="2115" />

so the fight got made again because after the third courtroom the judge says whose signature is this all seems that it was his you signed it yes well you got to give me the rematch this is you signed it to give me a rematch so you have to give me a rematch so I didn't want to hear that so I was happy. The reading how long did it take two years to years and that was all brawls in the ESPN studio in Hammond rockmont going to go find a receipt to cuz I have a slippery shoes in the world to fight press slippery shoes in the worst thing goes down together leather shoulder done oh my God on carpet. I don't remember did you have fights

<timemark seconds="2175" />

between how many fights did you have after Rock My World just waited so it took you two years it was it was because you never know if you're going to get the fighter or not or in all these guys are running from you they signed to fight a rematch because you know now they didn't want to sign it I remember when my right hand landed I remember when I was watching home I threw my arms up in the air

<timemark seconds="2203" />

I was like all the shit I went to sleep sleep but it was weak check this out man I need for a long time, you waiting for it

<timemark seconds="2216" />

in 04 this this fire Rahman can cut catch me cuz my speed was different in on South Africa was a lot slower now he got kind of grew frustrated because he couldn't get it man now on the top of the shoulder by Joe Cortez that was a phenomenal but I was probably one of the most satisfying one punch knockouts ever watched because I knew what you were gone through and I knew like everybody knew you were one of the greatest of all time and then to have you get ko'd like that person that made it endeared people too in a way because it showed your vulnerability but also your character and your ability to come back which is not easy man when you get stopped like that like psychologically it's got to be fucking with your head let me tell you the first time I lost everybody was coming up and shaking my head and say what what are you going to do now like what am I going to do now what you going to do now I'm going to go back and win championships okay you know they didn't think it was going to be possible

<timemark seconds="2276" />

but I'm thinking Muhammad Ali gain the championship three times so I've only lost it once I can do it again takes a special person to do it and I can do it did you do you feel like there was like two stages of your acrylic pre Emanuel Steward and post absolutely if you look at pictures skinny skinny kid to a man Dupree Dupree -2 you know me learning how to be a professional learning to Fight Pro and then once I got to Emmanuel we just like your he said hey you're a great fighter you know used to move around a lot of got to bring that back I cannot get cool so the move money brought back he called me a couple of Crunk tricks you know that check who can different things that the crunk Fighters do which works well

<timemark seconds="2336" />

and you know he was easy to understand then what what I liked about him what he said I can do I could accomplish he just told me what to do I'll do it if he said then we need to win this round I'll win that you have that kind of relationship I know he was really one of the great Masters another there are certain Masters when it comes to like boxing training like when you would hear him discuss Fighters like a really loved hearing him do commentary as well cuz he would discuss Fighters and what they need to do and he was always just dead on he just knew things he understood boxing so comprehensively he just knew what a fighter need to do that was so excited when he started working with you because it was like but that's that's exactly what Lenox needs so is HBO because you know is funny I'll do fights on HBO always doing this is not doing this he needs to do more needs to throw the job more than a manual start working for me inside always doing the job

<timemark seconds="2396" />

I'm going on TV that the commentators respecting they'll talk good about the boxer but you're not a good train is like what do they need to talk about a lot of shit in boxing, yeah yeah how they're guiding your brain to watch the fight it's more like sports commentary like mixed martial arts commentary I don't I don't do that I don't really talk shit ever I mean I catch Asian something's egregiously bad I'll talk about that you know this is real issues here but I try to try to just try hard at that cuz I wasn't always and I have not had to learn how to do it on the job nobody really knew how to do it wasn't a lot of people doing it before I start doing it but sucks because you're friends with all the fighters it's hard when you watch a friend of yours fuck up another friend of yours that's hard what about a friend of yours is doing something wrong that needs to do

<timemark seconds="2456" />

something right to tell him tell him privately mostly from for me I would like to know I wish I was like that I wish I could do that but you know people want more truth out of me so I'm trying to bring you across in the software and I'll make it too harsh I would bring I would say there's issues like I see something if I see like a vulnerability I will discuss that but if there's something that someone needs to work on a do I'll try to pull him aside and I'm but most of them know you know just so you know I'm sure a lot like boxer so there's different kinds of humans and some of them are just fucking while and those Wild Ones you know a lot of times they never become Champion but they're the most exciting people to watch like like Micky Ward like making words fights with a Toro guy there's some of the greatest because they were the way they matched up some of the I would never want one of my friends to fight like that two lunatics again oh my God man those fights were chaos though everybody knew that those guys weren't there never going to beat Mayweather than ever going to be

<timemark seconds="2516" />

best guys but God damn they were fun to watch some of the craziest you know who was it that had an arm injury in the still boxed was it Nicki wore Bernard Hopkins when he fought Antoine Echols like a permanent with a broken arm someone got their arm broke in the other pulled out them up and slam the bags to keep this short but he came back and won the rematch

<timemark seconds="2566" />

remember that call call them knocking them out in the next round with his left hand only one of the hardest fights for me to watch was Hopkins vs Joe Smith that was out of the ropes and landed on his head I was like man that is just first of all the fact that there was no padding on the ground is this God damn this is Bernard Hopkins where the greatest of all time and this is how this is setup you know and I didn't use on the ground they need to have something they're like no way more than apron know that's got to put more people ride or anybody's comes flying out yet go by the side of the guys phone off cuz they would use Rings which I don't like a man for MMA this is this pros and cons of the pro is that the cage the cage kind of like you can kind of hold a guy again against

<timemark seconds="2626" />

you can't really hold the guy very well against against route serious right here I mean like you fell on his head man I mean I think that's concrete he went through and somebody said it's interesting details in the fight for him if he was okay yeah somebody michon kitchen but nobody knows if he's all right or not right especially when you see him land on this year also he's 50 or 51 A1C 51 when you see a guy like him like how the fuck does a guy like that defy the odds and defy time I mean it's just a skill level

<timemark seconds="2686" />

intelligent intelligent smart doesn't party yeah he's still to this day I followed Instagram he's always training he's always exercising still look slim still looks good. True Focus he became that way like in his estimation because of prison time and I'm going to prison turned him into a disciplined man and I like realizing like like this is Rock Bottom I fucked up I need to I need to get my life in order and did you know imagine the people out there that commit a crime spend three four years in jail because some stupid crime they could spend that time training going to be in the world champion at something anything just develop use that time to develop yourself develop your mind you know when when I went Hopkins was

<timemark seconds="2746" />

they were already writing him off when he fought Felix Trinidad member that make everybody thought I was going to run him over. Forgot about that that was crazy they chased him out of the stadium yeah well I'm sure Tito had so much on his mind in that fight so much emotions you know and then that was the mental Warfare that Bernard what brought in that one for sure but then also he was just too good he was too good I mean he was just getting too big he had to hard like Trinidad really was a lighter-weight fighter than that it was going to run away yeah Corona to that same thing almost got done to that was crazy yeah that was crazy and

<timemark seconds="2805" />

I was like 36 of the time I get there I'll swing it on him and shit.. Jump yet to do what am I doing chasing a tiger ever have any thoughts at all once you finally retired like maybe one more gym have any comments like that I'll take my pajamas off for a hundred mil 70 series come with a baby show me the paper beat Tyson that was kind of at the end of his stage to write wasn't the same guy I looked at Tyson's history and I was coming from the same history

<timemark seconds="2865" />

you spend some time in the car situation while he was incarceration I'm still out there fighting and and training hard he didn't have that in there so when when he came out it's like you know

<timemark seconds="2878" />

he's training again he's doing what what what he knows not what he loves Brian Eno's desk was going to make him some money that's going to put food on the table so it's like I look at Old Time Fighters and what made them stay in boxing so long

<timemark seconds="2894" />

that's the only thing they knew where I didn't think they're not going to be no singer or dancer whatever they only know boxing and this is where they get their money from so they that's what that's what forces and back into the ring especially olden days that's what they were called prizefighters cuz they would make enough money to to make a living unless you would like a huge Red Robin but not the money that they would have been making if it was today was not I mean you know you had to go see it live how much I paid for the radio on the radio was it I think so one of those 1920s right when he was in jail he must have been doing something cuz it came out jacked

<timemark seconds="2954" />

like you look good like you came out looking different than we ever looked like six pack fully built when he fought Peter McNeeley better than you ever looked more ripped than ever so when I know, dude before it's enough skill are so he's probably you probably couldn't do any sparring I doubt they had a heavy bag but they probably had to wait room you know you can find prison fight to fight people yeah yeah I'm sure I'm shipping

<timemark seconds="3014" />

listen to a lot of shity things regard as funny when I seen him be arrested taken from the courtroom and they got they must have got the biggest Sky they could ever get to go put handcuffs on him or something like that anyway situation that I hope a lot of people stay away from ya when he went away did you feel like damn it like I'm going to miss out on that fight that I'm yes straight away is like I don't know I'm going to have to wait and delay my retirement I'll see you were waiting you are considering retirement even before he was incarcerated interesting choice in the bullfight bullfight chicken bowl you know you figured that chicken bow

<timemark seconds="3058" />

so we're all the ridiculous ridiculous Bowl chicken bowl try to pick a fight with me the other day if I use it in LA where they called all the great ones on Gerry Cooney me Foreman Spinx was there and what was he doing

<timemark seconds="3079" />

you wanted to stand beside me and take a picture of my tutu can't stand beside me cost at where I want to stand

<timemark seconds="3089" />

so you're trying to kind of helped us out there why I'm saved him cuz he time difference between a child who speaks perfect and a guy like him he's he's the the warning you know that's the warning to the young fighter can I see the two older guy who you know I saw an interview with him and it was sitting on the side of things I've ever seen it was horrible cuz I got to go back and I think about those fights with Holyfield looks like a crazy Wars and sane and you know you see he paid that price man he paid that price you can hear it when he's talking now it's rough it's hard to listen to a good news on the other side of Fighters coming out that Punchy I think with all the rules and changes that have been made you won't meet as many Punchy guys as you met from back in the day like you listen to pronounce you listen to ridicule listen to meldrick Taylor

<timemark seconds="3149" />

she was the best it was so slow with older Fighters is it Indianola football players is they become addicted to alcohol because like they're they're searching for something to try to recalibrate the brain you know I mean there's a scientific explanation to it that the people talk about people with traumatic brain injury often become alcoholics it's like they were trying to get some sort of a dopamine rush out of alcohol will have one drink and you can understand a word he's saying it was it in hits them so hard so hard it's like it's it's confusing it's like how it how you that drunk and then you realize this is

<timemark seconds="3209" />

thanks it's both think since it's the brain damage and the alcohol combined just the wheels come off the Carrie bad yeah it's it's awful but you made it out perfect man so far so far so far years will tell

<timemark seconds="3228" />

not really like I'm trying to keep my mind active I play a lot of chess chess do you play online with Roku ever jumps in the Bible how good are you play study chess not as much as I should I just play often and you know when you play offering there's you know people come out with the same move in Psycho I've seen this movie before I know what to do but you know depends does people that use the Palms to to to wage war user the knights or their Bishops in combination

<timemark seconds="3285" />

so it really depends on what type of player there I'm a I'm a bully play I like playing The Joe Rogan if he wants the podcast before Lenox to get one shot at it was good it was so that's a crazy game go on that table because I table as 4 inch pockets that's that's my practice table but I will look for it wait a minute I have a regular table at home

<timemark seconds="3344" />

bucket buckets I got the abyss stable you can't miss and it's it's dirty right now too so it's it's even it's even like that the cloth slow so balls don't drop unless they go right to this type of coffees up blood supply to pool table and Ani sold it to me yeah the guy just had it sitting in his basement in perfect condition it's a basement find yeah man that's a hard table to get to boil to squat guess what what you don't have to walk around and take the buckets of bows out of the ground and it's annoying but you probably have like a decorative pool table table

<timemark seconds="3404" />

as a solo man when you play chess are you like do you get ranked but you seem like you're yum yum points go up so I'm at 11:11 7700 right now so what is that like if you know if you're up to 14 your master so you're closing in on being a master well I wouldn't call me master yet but you know obviously if I get that I'm trying to get as high as possible pulled some chess even like okay yeah just come straight away is mentally intensive games to play with that. We hit the slap a clock on the

<timemark seconds="3462" />

the basket on the computer once you've made that move the time goes over three sets that's good that's that was that was fun I talk a lot of shit huh oh yeah they're good to their good the guy I was playing was talking a lot of shit yeah what did you have to ask that question it was just fun playing him when you get really good at chess and I'm not really going to chat but I have friends that are they explain to look it becomes your whole life like you start thinking like as you're walking on the street you thinking about Chess you just it becomes a thing where it's just everything it's all it's so with such an intense game wow online

<timemark seconds="3520" />

Washington Square Park in some master Supernatural

<timemark seconds="3539" />

model noodles those dudes love that game no man I mean this those guys were there if you go there and they'll be there every day they fucking live for it now it's some I'd say it's one of those things I really I really admire people that get get really really good at chess

<timemark seconds="3740" />

bumpers yeah but the whole table so yeah so big in Mexico it's real big in parts of Europe real big aneja down to a different game to two different color balls and I like to see the two white balls in a red ball or two red balls and white ball and you got to sometimes it's a yellow ball red ball and white ball in the ideas you make contact with one ball and then you have to hit three cushions and then they contact with the second ball it's complicated a music good to watch it Sprout if you know how to play it it's good to watch but if you don't know how to play that it's the thing about I what I like about pools I like when the balls disappear like you make a ball goes away goes in that hole by bitch how do you sync the ball it's like it's got a finality to it feels good but with that it just clicks it slow just ding ding ding click but the p

<timemark seconds="3800" />

it's a very intellectual game cuz it's all about geometry it's all angles and spin and It's Tricky Tricky game I'm not good at it

<timemark seconds="3812" />

I know what a little bit about table tennis I can play that I'm sure it will look you up like I have a real problem with quick you know how quick is my life video game Jamie's been fuck me up lately computer room set up in the back it gets intense yeah it is quite what is this Quake what is the outside 3D game where to a computer game you have all these weapons run around picking up weapons and you're you're on a map so it seems like every map is different but you don't listen to hear yeah yeah I told him you cut it up same spot well you butcher it you you you quarter it up want watch there so you can carry it out but you don't really like you want to

<timemark seconds="3872" />

at the meets I really want to get it out of the woods first to cool it off I want to do what you do with all the leftover leftover like what leftover Limbs and yeah if you leave the bones Bond and nothing goes to waste in the forest if you shoot an animal in the forest and leave the bones behind something to eat it if they don't eat delete most of it and I'll do they find it Bears will find it that you could system will take care of everything everything everything to take care of it isn't as big as you are you happy because I've been hunting since they were little so they bear and deer and Elk

<timemark seconds="3932" />

like my dick is I'm going on that we don't know where it's being right what kind of cigarettes the chicken or whatever and anything that might be bacteria is going to get killed I'm the real issue is when you have an animal that has parasites that's the issue so what if you're cooking a deer you don't have to worry about that cuz gears are herbivores or herbivores don't really have parasites but you can get money they can get some this is some worms that they did do get but most the time I got some pork is no that's pork definitely can the pork you get trichinosis that's pretty serious that's pretty serious shit I do not remind me some pork

<timemark seconds="3988" />

standard me the devil's Beast Lenox chicken all day love child a jerk chicken near where they have good jerk chicken swingers you know that I'm going to make it. Maybe your standards are higher cuz you're actually to make it right but for me it's tasty, I know you need to go okay I think you would like it there to go to Jamaica because everybody was totally different stories and stuff but it says of paradise over there

<timemark seconds="4049" />

that you can see different colors you know cuz I spent a long long time in London and when I left London to go to Jamaica is like wow all these different vibrant colors even in the water colors in the trees and driving around London it's gray I like I like contacts with contact with plants vibrant thing you know a lot of people do forget that you were from England right and that there was a stigma with English boxers for the arrow a long time and you be broke that you would have because the I heard that was British boxers or of a horizontal yes well they were more vertical they would stand straight up and they would have liked that European style but it was like Henry Cooper remember when Henry Cooper drop Muhammad Ali and then they cheated or cut his gloves one of the last great English boxers before you came

<timemark seconds="4109" />

and then for a long time it was guys that were pretty good like Frank Bruno pretty good but then they would get in there with guys like Tyson and they would always wind up losing so everybody had these like this is our guy this is the one in Frank Bruno damn that he looked the part was there ever a man more jacked as a heavyweight boxing at Frank Bruno

<timemark seconds="4133" />

I mean nobody has never been a Better Built box or ever will you look at Frank Bruni on Hugo how does he not kill everybody is so big you should see Frank Bruno now cuz you're really phenomenal genetics must be phenomenal genetics even a day to like 65 sardos cruiserweight he was a much smaller guy that was that was like his big fight like to prove himself as a professional cuz, we was tricky 5-7 200lb it was weird vitamins that was the American Olympic trials right well.

<timemark seconds="4193" />

he had a lot of it at one time he had big legs Frank Bruno back when he was in his prime as a boxer who is gigantic man

<timemark seconds="4214" />

but he was sculpted as a boxer ever gets here are either going to be really want is not even a good picture of the best yeah he was so jacked

<timemark seconds="4225" />

yeah, we was a crazy the Camden buzzsaw he was such a crazy fight because he would pull his shorts up till after year and he was fine with that Philly shell and come in real low and all he was a very good at Archie Moore dealer almost who really stands out to you didn't get to be champions for no reason each one of them have different qualities you know even what is the cat the heavyweights all the heavyweights the top three heavyweights right now they're all over 6 ft 5 and they all have a different style which is good because you know reminds me of when we in the Holyfield and Tyson around will have different styles which makes great fights now it's to guess which. Was going to beat Wichita you never know because they're all similar you know they all all three

<timemark seconds="4285" />

some have milk help attention and you know they're boxing to win so what we want to see we want to see who would win out of them Deontay Wilder to me is the most perplexing because he hits so hard it's it's almost like he's got magic in his hands he makes guy fly across the ring and he's only seen on TV the Olympic bronze-medal year-and-a-half in the Box pedigree but please but Ortiz much older than how old is he or she is like 49 how do you know somebody told me about from the Amsterdam ever seen him in the amateurs in the 80s

<timemark seconds="4345" />

he just bought on the weekend or two weeks ago a couple weeks ago. It's right last week and two months ago to now also he's very he's being very active what it was really comes down to you know this is how it goes if you're starting boxing obviously you want to have as many fights as possible to you no seasoning experience level so as much as possible it's usually for fights a year

<timemark seconds="4388" />

and then as you get better drops to three fights and then when you're the champion the drops the two fights so that's that's the progression of fighting you can't like for instance how many fights did Deontay have this year maybe two Bryant Bryant yeah he's very angry that this is not happening with him was at Tyson and Tyson got a deal with ESPN pulled off the greatest Chestnut to move there is

<timemark seconds="4428" />

first he comes over from England he wouldn't he takes the challenges with Deontay Joshua didn't he boxed had a great fight now he's put himself right up with off all three of them on the same line to me and then now for the rematch they wanted people want to see Deontay and they want to see Tyson Fury again because the first fight was exciting Joshua

<timemark seconds="4455" />

who's he fighting you know he's going to fight big baby but nobody knows him why everybody knows Deonte boxing fans. Especially after that fight cuz it was such a spectacular fight oh my God the first knockdown was great the second knockdown was Preposterous or the fact that he rose like Lazarus I mean it was crazy and then stops and starts boxing and then even tagged Deonte I still had them winning that fight was close great and box 12 meters exciting fight that the rematch obviously everybody wants to see the remix again so when the rematch happen.. Put on Anthony Joshua on the shelf on the Shelf a bit longer with this ESPN deal

<timemark seconds="4514" />

the public yeah Anthony Joshua and Deontay pay-per-view right now who are they going to fight Pay-Per-View nobody wants to see no silly fight they want to reply so you know it's a it's a great moved by Tyson Fury it's a great move without the first fight that the the fight ended in a draw all right yeah yeah so in the drawer Deonte keeps the title but at least I seen walks away like saying like look I won the decision I feel like I should have won the decision there's a dispute is a debate about it but everybody wants to see that fight Tyson lose to somebody at each other because if Joshua fight Spherion loses to Fury Joshua's a star goes down if she watch real fights

<timemark seconds="4574" />

wants real respect he's got to fight either Fury or deante roast those are the big fat butt split you know that's a weird thing to see Joshua Ortiz it would be around 7 or 10 I don't remember but I remember when he caught him was like even laid in the snow down there Louis Pasteur's Prime is a good fighter but you know give him give give in like 10 years and he would have he would have beat these guys he would have given them a good good fight but right now he's obviously older and he's an old fighter doing some steroids

<timemark seconds="4634" />

Giuseppe on body so you know when you reach that point where you need steroids mentally ill effects you know you going to the ring inside you know you're missing something something that was there in the past and it made you feel good now time. I don't feel as good when you were fighting did anybody that you were fighting did you suspect they were on something a couple times but I know is I realized steroids steroids can never get this a strong your chin chin so you can take as much time as you want but I'mma hit you on the chin up muscles on your face says you can't you can't protect around here so they will affect you as well so that's where you know when you when you when you hitting guys around here body punches and hit him on the chin doesn't matter but don't you think that it does makes them stronger physically gives them more Vitality might make them able to absorb

<timemark seconds="4694" />

more punishment for a minute for a minute just for a little bit for a little bit suspect was on something when he fought them I don't want to say I think I better was the first guy that's as far as I'm concerned was the first time I actually asked him if he's been on Stewart now I never actually hung out with a victory party into it I didn't know that he was the first guy to have a strength and conditioning coach and all that kind of stuff when he fought Larry Holmes he got the same guy Mackie shilstone in shape for Larry when he was coming up from light heavyweight that's the same guy that have and are used and they were doing it was really interesting because at the time that the conventional wisdom was a boxer should know

<timemark seconds="4754" />

weights and Evander was lifting all kinds of weights and he put on all this muscle but really he was only about 200 205 lb when it was built in spray perfect body yeah I mean there are guys alleged but it's also possible to get that big with steroids but it's not just steroids to its EPO there's only that one up there in the night 80's 90's the good stuff wasn't available back then was it Eastern Bloc women they made world records that was when he was a cruiserweight look out any was but you can call me

<timemark seconds="4814" />

I've been broken because they really were not women I mean they were women with massive amounts of male hormones in their body Flo-Jo yeah she sets the record right now from what whatever it was went and she was also someone that was accused of doing things yeah me and look track and field according to Victor Conte who was the Palco guy I had on my podcast was a guy that got the clear to Barry Bonds and all those guys will be undetected supposedly undetectable steroid he said track and field is just a dirty sport just like Tour de France like just like cycling's like it's a dirty sport. Carl I was trying to call out and crossed out how steroids

<timemark seconds="4868" />

well that's like when Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France and they took his title way if you had to give that title to someone who didn't test positive for anything you want to go back to 18th Place Elementary sport in a Bill Burr said he's like yours are psycho is better than your psycho they're all you were all dirty there's a dirty sport he was just better at doing that sport while being dirty then it's fair I mean it is definitely cheating but everybody's cheating that's weird it's not good you know they went off to the wrong thing you know people looking for drugs to help them get stronger when it's natural food that makes you stronger with what you put into your system so you know I know what you're making food is great you know yams plantings Everything But Loose Leaf bully beef

<timemark seconds="4928" />

it was better than that steroids almost can't do Tour de France the way they were doing it without some sort of chemical help geologists they say it's actually better for your body to be on steroids while you're doing something like the Tour de France because you give your body a chance to recover because they're doing so much work over the course of this race that without having some sort of chemical enhancement of your ability to recover you just not going to be able to do it now about your body can't do you get that Rhabdomyolysis that those CrossFit people get and I know that's when your body starts breaking down muscle tissue and becomes toxic

<timemark seconds="4988" />

overtraining you you over-train Unity like something you don't which is a big issue with Fighters right like they some Fighters can train too much and a good trainer knows how to pull you back and so that you're peeking when you get into the rent but sometimes people are so mentally strong they push themselves through even their exhausted because I think that's the way to Victory hard work what's up Jamie yeah you piss comes out looking like Coke comes out looking like Coca-Cola that's what Rhabdomyolysis piss looks like yeah that's that's a sign that your your body is breaking down your muscle is your proteins your body a break down in your body is getting poisoned by it people die a lot of CrossFit people get it what's your kidneys what are you doing this situation do you take a rest a leave of absence or to go to the doctor and they can give you some pills to put more assist thing that you need in your system I think you have to go to the doctor almost immediately I think they have to do your body goes septic

<timemark seconds="5048" />

yeah it's very dangerous and the lot of these CrossFit people you know because it's a competition and you competing it's all these other people to do his massive repetitions and some of them is not really condition for it yet so their bodies just the muscles not really acclimated to this kind of workload and it's the shit starts breaking down what do you do these days like when you go on the beach nice

<timemark seconds="5082" />

so you still do but listen listen listen all right it's a bad day tell him then I got to go outside and not close my sunroof and he's like when are you going to pay for my fucking car to get fixed if I'm going to go I'm pulling your leg right now yes

<timemark seconds="5239" />

mostly cuz you're doing Jiu-Jitsu now you know after training fantastic for you to go to sleep aromatherapy at top of finger smells good but it's not that it's this magnesium in it up some salt your body absorb magnesium through your Through Your Skin it's one of the best ways for your body to get magnesium Epsom salt water that's heated to 94° which is like the surface of your skin and there's a thousand pounds Epsom salts in there and you lay in it and you float you like like your body half your body is above the water they close the door total silence total darkness it feels like you're flying through space beautiful you would love it

play one of those two tanks you shouldn't worry about that stuff but exploding you know it was some shit going wrong and getting maimed you know so do you do enjoy doing commentary to yeah

<timemark seconds="5377" />

I love I love giving my opinion you know people are sell colored unusual opinions if they've never heard that before I never heard it put that way so you know I can give you from afar. Afar this point of view have been inboxing for so long this different experiences I've gone through so I'm happy to share them but you don't ever work out boxing watch anymore but you don't have to hit a bag my son is 15 and I know he he wants to box so anytime we get a chance you know I'm always training him Jesus yeah I told him Tyson Tyson son is 16 on the Galleria Tysons and was saying that he wants a box to Tyson's like listen and you used grew up soft and then he saying like you don't want to meet someone like me

<timemark seconds="5431" />

you know I like the way he was the same as kids like when he was fighting a cutie like you think so what he would have done to his own Sons like don't do that you talk about on the podcast will Tyson's a smart guy he's not like he has it he's very small boxing is it in at least some levels of very very intellectual Pursuit you have to have a strong mind to be able to Dodges punches get in and get yours in that you have to you have to be able to sort out that problem is a problem in front of you the problem is another man who's the same weight as you the same size as you he's got gloves on just like you do and he's trying to do what you're trying to do to him and you have to do that within seconds

<timemark seconds="5491" />

YouTube what's what's the rebuttal just because someone doesn't have the best vocabulary or because they don't have a comprehensive education that they're not intelligent that's a big mistake no intelligent I remember going to the Catskills when I was I won the World Junior Championships in Santo Domingo Dominican Republic and I remember the American team was in all well you never fought the best life been for the past American team yeah but one guy is like taking plans and it's not just don't like taking plans either somebody who's that and he told me was Mike Tyson cus D'Amato so me and my trainer we left Canada and we drove all the way up there and while we're up there a razor ruddock was up there and listen to Raising Cane's in spy with us it's okay with you I'm here for four days so first time Tyson actually met me you know he was nice guy really nice

<timemark seconds="5551" />

guy took me in his room show me some old flicks I've never seen before of old-time Fighters would tell me about each fighter it's like he started them and then you know this is where he got his old star is his style of fighting from and first day in the first day in the gym bell went he came across and he was trying to kill me like you know I did my Muhammad Ali thing obviously stayed away from his power but the first day was really hectic and then the second day was like taking that got better as it went a long way in the last day is I got action the better of him the last and I remember Custom Auto Send Mike you going to meet him someday don't you do that and not always a cold in my mind that we we ever fight will we ever fight cuz Custom Auto said that we're going to fight and it did happen and this footage of it Lennox has the footage of it

<timemark seconds="5607" />

footage of the training session Safari how old was Tyson time to know know how old was he was he was younger than me I was like he's about 17 18 and up there before you went to the 84 Olympics were going to be a part of boxing history and knowing that all the way back then it being a teenager and standing front here in custom auto screen that out

<timemark seconds="5648" />

Bossman intense it was intense because custom motor wasn't that loud when he was when he all of a sudden he became loud is like everybody listened you know and then he noticed certain ways that you came across the people in some some people take you out to shout at them did you ever wish that you fought him in his prime in that since I did find them in his prime and you know when you say Prime I was in my Prime to you know you would definitely in your Prime you were you were but I feel like his enthusiasm had waned before then you know you know is my perception how I look at that whole thing is Mike Tyson was an early Bloomer I was a late bloomer so you know when when both of us meet you know there's never a perfect time perfect time for us is when we meet in the middle and maybe people would look at it differently just because you beat him and beat him so soundly the people look at it like maybe his is time at

<timemark seconds="5708" />

next turn pro aftermarket already had to defeat wow 89 wow I never even thought of that up in the Catskills is crazy man God that's crazy big neck Bridges but he also just had freak genetics I'm just a phenomenal genetic specimen you know what I had Teddy Atlas in here and tell you how I was supposed to take Mike to The Smokers when he was 13 and Teddy was joking around about us at everybody always lied about how old people were to tell you the kid is 16 really was 20 they always did that and he said he goes so why how old is Katie was 13 Boise juegos 190 lb the fuck Teddy come on what do you want

<timemark seconds="5768" />

because you're such a specimen I watch that one should have stayed with Teddy

<timemark seconds="5775" />

to stay with Kevin and Teddy he definitely you know he was so wild like how how could you tell him what to do back then that was part of the problem I mean he was never no one ever prepared him and is one of the things we discussed on the podcast was that he was a twelve-year-old 13 year old boy and he's getting hypnotized he had we came from a terrible background was there was no love he was abandoned and all the sudden he's getting love and attention for something and it's one thing was this man who was telling him you're going to be a great fighter you're going to be a world champion and he would hypnotize me saying you don't exist the task exist you know you can work the body and destroy this man and you could tell he would put these thoughts in his head and my couldn't wait to just get out there fuck people out cuz that's where you got the love that's why we got the attention from but he never turned never told me how to shut it off he never have time to work with him cuz he was he was on his way out just dying when he met Mike and so he only taught him how to destroy you never taught him how to cope you never taught him how to

<timemark seconds="5835" />

understand that there's going to be a lot of shit coming your way and you got to know what that is don't get caught up in that hype-train don't just don't get wrapped up in Hollywood and you know he wand up marrying Robin Givens and you know what is force all that other bullshit Mike would be totally different. Yeah maybe it would have helped but I mean it's like once you were once removed from cuss it's like Kevin Rooney was once removed from cops right and then Teddy Atlas was way more of a hardliner you know Teddy Atlas you couldn't pull any bullshit with you know in like those other guys just got to you got to Aaron snowell and all those guys go with him to the dance Sprite they got there when he's already at the dance and they just trying to like maintain things and he's not listening to anybody Mike Tyson

<timemark seconds="5895" />

he was in a good situation you know there's a lady in the house cooking meals they had caused the custody of being a father figure talk to him everyday and that's what young kids need they need that you know to be spoken with by older people yeah you know a lot of the young people nowadays are not even respect in the older people but they can gain a lot of information from a older person you know how do you do with this situation here from a older person that kind of makes your mind thinking so you know you're right it works for them so anytime I get a chance to talk to kids about you know their life and where they're going to take that opportunity such a great example of a guy who is done incredible things but you've come out on the other end with with wisdom and lessons and honesty and you can talk about things and people will listen to you in a way that you know a lot of kids that don't want to listen to some of ain't done shit right you need to talk to some guys just some boring do do you want to give you advice like a fuck face by the ear ocean together

<timemark seconds="5955" />

what to do when your Lennox Lewis you talk together okay Mr World Heavyweight Champion it was Lennox Lewis League of Champions for young kids. You know learn how to box teach me Teach mother box from teaching life skills as well because what we realized that you know a lot of the kids just want to talk you know there's nobody around them to talk nobody has sense to them and when they hear other kids stories they feel a lot better so I can go you know I was going through that and I like how we dealt with it you know it's like it yes this is what we what's missing nowadays yes the relationship with kids you know talking to them yeah right right right and then have some place where they can go in and have something that gives them a sense of value you know and that's what a lot of sports does it do de to Children gives him

<timemark seconds="6015" />

you realize if you work hard and you try something and you study and you get better at it you feel good like you accomplished that you got through whatever the sport is a lot of a lot of the kids that come boxing I've never tried it before but once they try it it's like wow they learn new things about themselves even the training of boxing yeah you know the fact of us one of my they'd never end in their life now the run half a mile didn't make the mile for the next step next day they want to try them out and then you just it shows them that if you keep working at something you accomplished it you know don't give up don't of a sudden you tried in the sky. For me keep trying it you don't know it's not for you until you keep trying it and then realize it's not for you or for you

<timemark seconds="6059" />

what do you do if your son wants to fight let him

<timemark seconds="6062" />

yeah I think your perspective would be very different than Mike's from from me you know I'm not forcing my son to box but if he wants to try it let him try his father used to box so why not want to try something his father did maybe has the gene for it yeah I know right now my my sons play the playlist basketball he wants to be an actor he loves boxing he can do anything he wants you know all my kids are talented am I see but driving them that I have and their mother has so I know that they're going to be successful you know their there they're basically I'm trying to help them to become successful in the future and give him the tools to become successful in the future as well good for you too man with a lucky young man and young women to you know me as well but for sure but that means to be your son if you really do have a desire to box would you start training him

<timemark seconds="6118" />

I'm trying to George Foreman the other day and his. One of his daughters were fighting in her name George by the tone apparently which one it is I'm watching her fight and I'm like George you need to tell us some stuff I know this some good things you can tell her or even get her a proper cultural you know helper I don't want to fight

<timemark seconds="6159" />

so they have to say yeah but if you don't want her to fight and she's fighting you're not going to help us going to get hurt so I might as well I don't I don't have any input under what they do I don't know what I don't know what I would never tell my kid I don't want you to do that cuz it's not my life it's their life I give them guidance if I can I'll talk to them about what they're doing if I can but they also have to go out and do it themselves and I really firmly believe in that like you got to go do it yourself but if you want to do it that's your thing I tried to convince my daughter to want to do just really see if you mix but you got bored with it after a while which is cool to you no later than 10:00 and 8 in the who knows maybe we'll come back to it but you know I kind of whispered to my son right now

<timemark seconds="6219" />

glencadam in Jiu-Jitsu Tonya MMA

<timemark seconds="6226" />

you know I don't know what the future holds you may fight MMA box just because the money factor yeah you know if your heavyweight MMA fighter to make a lot of money and I know he's 6ft and he wears size 15 shoes

<timemark seconds="6266" />

just need to find skip a pair of shoes by the front door so I was going to roll me like a puppy outgrow their parents I don't know I think it's food I think they get better food than us yeah I think you know that you think about like how much protein children have now you're back and look at like how big men were during like the Civil War. According to make a hundred pounds if they're tiny little people cuz nobody had good food like everybody was like barely surviving ever a scraping bottom of bread and water X across the skinny rickety looking people to start a tougher than we could ever be today kids are getting in a massive amounts of protein and they get vitamins and vegetables and you know drinking all this milk and Foods got shit and that too but I just think it's just an abundance

<timemark seconds="6326" />

mean when people are smaller a lot of it was because of malnutrition like look at Asian folks like a lot of Japanese folks used to be much smaller than that they're pretty fucking big and you're getting some really big Japanese Fighters are there larger testicle eating better you know what I wanted to ask you please conspiracy theories I know you have something with something about martians the other day I was a private islands, yeah yeah I believe she said that even Alex thinks it's ridiculous conspiracy theories do you want to know about population control to believe that no I don't believe that I don't do this any concerted effort like where there's a bunch of really rich people that have decided to euthanize a bunch of people to keep the popular

<timemark seconds="6386" />

I think that is that's paranoid I think that there's probably some people to go you know what we would be a lot healthy if there was less people but there's no there's no obvious effort the population keeps fucking growing imagine if you were the all-powerful all-knowing people that are running the world he doing such a shity job of population control in China you're not you're not you're not bugging dirty Villages and try to stop being like to fuck you like to make people in China you only loved one kid because horrible shit this is the rumor is that people where they wanted a son that they had a daughter they would win cuz there's

<timemark seconds="6446" />

easier to deal with really I find with my daughter I were more like this yeah you know what man I mean just be happy. Joseph Lennox Lewis Peters coming next month, next Revan Peters he's going to be amazing what's your middle name yes my middle name is Claudius claudianus let's get out of here to do you have a heart out know you can say there's definitely some people that are influencing the way the world works for sure but I don't think there's anybody that's really trying to

<timemark seconds="6499" />

control population what about this one do you think the Russians put Donald Trump in the president's chair I think the Russians absolutely wanted Donald Trump to win absolutely and I think they definitely undermined our democracy through various methods of manipulating people to social media in fact I have a woman coming on very soon when is Renee the restaurant this week next week she's on next week and she actually studied it and wrote wrote this very comprehensive report about it was on Sam Harris podcast and detailed millions of interactions with Russian Bots and Russian fake accounts and that these troll Farms that we create memes and they did they do a bunch of different things they didn't just try to pump trump up but they also tried to get people against each other and and cause all sorts of civil arguments and all sorts of unrest they organized

<timemark seconds="6559" />

meetings like they organized one pro Texas meeting across the street from a pro Muslim meeting I did it on purpose old to take sides and to get people to be angry at the other side they did a lot of shit like that real sneaky sneaky stuff that we probably do in foreign countries all the time and we know we're mad that they're doing it to us cuz now they're doing it through social media and it was Brandon it was destitute some of it was true though propaganda so true you never saw the hot Russian movies

<timemark seconds="6619" />

we will hide yeah yeah I have two friends are married to Russian ladies they're very happy now the question cuz because you're American everything I'm not American soul is this wall ever going to get what's the situation but I think it was more of a campaign rhetoric thing and I'll Build That Wall Build That Wall 51 supporters I think he's got a kind of do something right once you say that you going to build a wall you got to kind of do something but they ain't shit and built for two years into the president then build shed or left if you're going to have left in the Presbyterians some wall there's some wall that's up but is also a big ass gaps and the idea that they going to stop drugs from coming over from that wall is crazy

<timemark seconds="6667" />

why you son of a bitch but when Muhammad Ali lost Leon Spinks and then there was a rematch we watch it on television everybody everybody want to rolly to win people forget that I wasn't just a great boxer in the heavyweight champ of the world he represented people that were against the war he represented people that were against all of the all the discrimination and all the racism experienced in the 50s and 60s he was a different thing he was he represented the hope of this new generation that this athlete would take a stand and he said that no Vietcong never did anything to me and I'm not going over there and fight anybody took away his ability to earn a living for 3 fucking years and he was a hero a real so she can or some shit you know they would have had him cologne

<timemark seconds="6727" />

and I'm just just to make it look like he was doing something he's like no no fucking chance you know he stood up for it and my parents were hippies wanted wanted him to win my mom didn't give a fuck about boxing but when I was a little kid boxing match because of what he stands for

<timemark seconds="6752" />

my dad felt that way about Joe Louis and Robinson Joe Louis beat Max Schmeling for the world like it wasn't it mean if I feel terrible for Max Schmeling because I mean he would probably just caught up in all that shit but maximum said he wasn't part of it was just he was just a pawn in the game I'm sure I'm sure. My favorite that's the craziest let me know where in Lennox Lewis Jack Johnson from my favorite slick talk you bad my favorite one is a meme a photo of him in his car is it I don't even know if the stories true of the FIB building I'm coming back tonight since he had to give the guy $50 that was the fee give the guy a hundred does what's this for his only come back later that night

<timemark seconds="6810" />

and get in the backseat of texting the guy cuz I don't drive niger's and any reached over pull the game of the backseat got in front drum sets we had to get to myself I need one of those true listen to The Book of Jack Johnson wrestling for the time but I think he was only 6 to you know anybody was they call them the Galveston giant GQ Magazine rated him as best dressed athlete of the century 2000

<timemark seconds="6848" />

throngs Andre you know I mean any of us could even imagine what it must have been like when he won the title and the kind of hate that he got all the people that wanted him to be killed this shit he did was so gangster he would hit you up and say this guy boxing gym see his fight with Stanley ketchel and then

<timemark seconds="6908" />

play the little gloves horsehair different world MMA fighters find out the hard way like you can't just you can open up with boxing and not even worry as much about what you're hitting you cannot do that if you're fighting bare knuckle is the fishing at bare knuckle boxing for his name was in it recently but a lot of UFC fighters that nobody has a Rover or football football players

<timemark seconds="6960" />

I saw him doing the bare knuckle thing Italian guy yeah I love the quite a few MMA fighters Melvin Guillard did some it's so you know but it's sort of a last resort kind of thing trying to pick up a paycheck you know Chris Lytle did it you know it's just a hard way to make a living somewhere

<timemark seconds="6990" />

what time did you say the time tell this motherfucker to sit down it's your boy who am I talking to him so lennox's fella is talking to your fellow assistant knows better well people get silly it's like a good meal you know once I know what do they have you doing after this just more interviews by big they got me busy these are what are you promoting promoting the flights you can promote it started opinion contest turn up the Beet summer to 4:30 to put some two-way glass there when we can see out and I can't see in

Nicosia

<timemark seconds="7079" />

boxing course she's tell me I'll tell you everything about the heavyweights are you doing, Tyrannosaur nice to be good fight should be very good fight

<timemark seconds="7098" />

every every time Shawn Porter Sky reminds me of the old time fighters to get away all this guy fights you know gives you a lot of pressure is on you tell me to eat out enticed I though he doesn't he doesn't mind taking the shots at 2 to punch he mixes it up Earl Spence Jr fight makes me nervous. Everybody wants to see I think my keys Plus in this fight is that spends hasn't had pressure like this and my key doesn't tank out on anybody is not gas out and he's not afraid to mix it up with you what about the size difference

<timemark seconds="7158" />

what's the size difference of weight difference I mean I would prefer it might have one more fight before they know what they're doing and that rhyme with his brother before with Robert lomachenko was their training day I went up there right now working with the light heavyweight Russian character and over at goossens Jim over the Christmas holiday how did you realize boxed in two years oh my God I suck your hands might have did you wrap them I'm a wrecking to type can you go soft hands

<timemark seconds="7217" />

it's been two years old I do this okay let me know when you know what you do martial arts comes in buddy this thing of sand and you just start punching it soon can you upload something you want to do a lot of this outside rice bag is very good for your hands

<timemark seconds="7263" />

what what did you do about it I had to bring a tennis ball everywhere and squeezes did you just see how what are the Finger thing it's nice as it give you more traction tubes it's not necessarily but it just keeps your fingers together listen to for a threat I look at that that's it for two Finger Joint I used to three

<timemark seconds="7323" />

it's weird was a weird I'll do it now but Venom I know but but you in a long time and I start to get to 96 rolling tomorrow at 8:30 in the morning if that's yeah that works and how we could do that what's different about Jiu-Jitsu and wrestling what's the what's the difference on whether or not using the Giza big factor cuz you could grab a hold of that and it saw it makes you more defensive-minded because you can get caught in things can cotton submissions easier submission to the big thing obviously but I do a lot of noogie I have a black belt in Yogi Jiu-Jitsu ND Jiu Jitsu I actually prefer no that's all I want to do tomorrow we do whatever we do game I don't care I don't do I just don't use it you know I let people grab mine but I'd I try to use Arm bars and chokes

<timemark seconds="7383" />

things that I would do know that's how I trained from Gita noogie so that I could do both I just decided I'm just going to train in the Gigi like I don't have one on like let people grab the I'll be recognized that I have it on so people can grab me but I don't crap there's I just use over Hooks and under Hooks and

<timemark seconds="7403" />

yeah. Trying to make a joke out of Yogi Josie Gaylord it is definitely a slower game like older dudes in particular they seem to like the ghee cuz I can kind of control you and it's good and it could also be used against you to do is get in a fight with a judo black belt when you get a winter coat on a suit Miami on your head

<timemark seconds="7435" />

we're looking at you it's all gravy out now right when you think you're on your way right training I may be little dumbbells and and yoga ball to buy that's it get someone like that it'll it'll make a big difference it's like thing about your your body is like a race car right if you could just lift weights in your race car will go faster when you do that like if you was a thing you could do you get activated talking about tennis elbow problem with my elbow you you hold it like that like you twisted like this

<timemark seconds="7492" />

and then you untwist it with your arm so you hold it like this twist and then untwisted he do it slowly and it works on these tendons the same tendency that you get wet just so shity how I got it in sleep could we have him try that right now

<timemark seconds="7508" />

that means a lot heavier than it looks so you twisted and then untwist it

<timemark seconds="7513" />

yeah like like twist it like that right and then leveled out and then slowly untwisted

<timemark seconds="7520" />

sounds good yeah just going to do it over and over and over again little bit

<timemark seconds="7526" />

it's far more dense than it looks yeah it's great for your attendance it specifically work this part of your arm like down in here

<timemark seconds="7536" />

that's good to know what else is good or older you know like when you have one of those phone lines no cord with a way to the bottom of it and you got to roll it with your people just used to fabricate them in the gym

<timemark seconds="7563" />

you would be awesome if you did to I guarantee you because you're a chess player juice is very sorry bro you know it's very it's like the boxing obviously is very sorry but do you limit in your weapons you don't have a certain amount of angles you could punch from where's Jiu-Jitsu there's an endless combinations of transition say that keto he gave me time for that person manipulate your bone and drops a whole way on Turnpike shout as I should the people yeah Marcelo Garcia is tap people out like high-level people with wrist locks in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments

<timemark seconds="7623" />

you can do this if she has some nasty shit the thing is like there's no end to Jiu-Jitsu there's no entender and these are all the moves and that's it and people keep inventing moves turn on the news yesterday one rubber guard assassins on Instagram crazy Kimora you do from a close guard that leads to a triangle Mike want that only has to let you do a lot of things to some of them up your knee joints cuz you got to be very flexible get the rubber guard in yeah just stretch stretch I don't know how you put a q put somebody between your legs and then you pull your leg over their head but there has to pop through so you now you controlling and hold their head this way

<timemark seconds="7681" />

it's a lot of fucking rubber oenis that I don't have the ability to do it was invented by my friend Eddie Bravo but did the but there was some guys who would play high guard before that he just put it into a very this is a good example of it that's what it looks like so he's pulling down using his his leg and his arms to control a guy and wrap some up and while he's down while he's on the bottom looks like a greasy move it is supposed to get to move so the Bravo move all G Jitsu essential

<timemark seconds="7716" />

Eddie and Jo came up under my teacher and then Eddie took it to another level from their daddy just branched out and you know when into noogie he's much more complete has blackmailed McGee as well much more concerned with noogie techniques because he wanted techniques that would work in mixed martial arts so it makes martial arts you don't have the collars to grab the sleeves to grab so he wanted to invent a system that you could use especially when you have the ability to fight off your back is very it when you fight that's been Saunders who's like one of the best at it in MMA if you get wrapped up you're on top of a do knee wraps you up his legs like that is very is it's very demoralizing that's fine if you got a good garlic John jock

<timemark seconds="7768" />

yeah I'm interested in that what do you live these days you still live in Toronto play some earlier Scots was playing and everybody was there a such a perfect City it's like the people are nice but it's Urban like it's very populated is a lot of people but they don't have that asshole vibe that like New York has like it's the fifth largest city in North America is it glass

<timemark seconds="7816" />

rentas Market Eagle stop it now it's the stores and all the stores in the street like they're opening like about 25 or 50 in Toronto so the government's gave him a great place man I did that place that you do that at the Scotia Canada Centre Scotiabank called Scotiabank a month before me when I get home before my Netflix special came out that came out in October so I think I was there around then I fucking love it up there man that's probably one of my favorite cities to visit come on back I love it Massey Hall love that place

<timemark seconds="7876" />

right that's right yeah that was a good time at the UFC's are always great to good support they loved it up there Canada in general like ask you this why are people so nice there so much nicer than Americans it's I don't know it's different this nice Americans are more polite I find that to be nicer as far as I think Canadians are polite but we'll talk shit about you take that take that over being rude in which Americans are considered very forward and you know it it's it's an outgoing thing so where it where is in America

<timemark seconds="7936" />

this person so aggressive from like we're going to be like excuse me I'd like to ask you a question how good is the the community in in Canada is it like the comedian in America where there's a lot of up-and-coming people or is it as much as a lot of comics in Canada the problem is there's no the money is not there so no matter her around like like the club don't you tap out at like maybe you'll make let's see what that's sick shows on a weekend I had a good headliner can make 1,200 bucks that's it I mean that's pretty fucking insane yeah it's rough especially if they're selling out and making drinks at the club I like going to the UFC almost to a certain degree it's not about the comic it's about the name of the club like yuck yuck

<timemark seconds="7996" />

UFC's about UFC fighter is used to have that attitude some of the clubs in La Comics strike way back in the 70s in the comics are the ones who were providing the art form of the clubs in ones and making all the money and they were like a you know you were you you're at the Improv are you at The Comedy Store to pay scale at these clubs the same as which is fucking horrible like I take people out on the road with me and and the clubs will pay fifty bucks run MC for the weekend and a hundred bucks for the future and I'm like that's fucking that's what it was. That's crazy this sounds terrible. How are these kids going to make a living well in a way it's a lot like boxing cuz like when people think the boxes make millions of dollars does Floyd Mayweather make $100 in a fight that is true but if you look at the undercard like there's guys that are fighting for chump change I mean and they are going through a Long Camp the first paycheck

<timemark seconds="8056" />

boxing paycheck 5011 still that's $5,000 for a fucking professional fight but you are quick and Tyler deal is going to add up after a while

<timemark seconds="8072" />

yeah I mean you're at you're an exception I mean those guys fighting out there for like eight hundred bucks and I mean yeah yeah it's supposed to boxing is the win-lose bonus I don't like that I think the fighter I think a fighter should get paid what they're supposed to get paid no one's trying to lose if you're trying to lose you never going to be able to compete at the highest level anyway these guys are pouring their heart and soul that giving their body that there are literally sacrificing their health and they might get fucked out of a decision and because of that it was 50% of their money so some incompetent judge which inboxing is everywhere and then it'll a bird how dare you people that don't even do it anymore because they

<timemark seconds="8132" />

imagine if 50% of your purse goes away because someone doesn't know what the fuck their do when lose bonus do you get 10 + 10 so you get $10,000 to fight in ten thousand more if you win crazy if it's fit often times 50% and the ideas that you're going to give these Fighters and incentive to put on a better show I think I don't like I don't like when people fight any different than the way they're fighting when they're fighting the best in the smartest but I think you should fight intelligently you shouldn't engage in a wild bra because you want some performance bonus you know because like they'll give out performance of the night or knockout of the night can you can you lose and still get the fight of the night but he's got a ton of those he would fight that way if you gave him a guarantee

<timemark seconds="8192" />

half million dollars a fight no matter what he would fight exactly that way that's how we fight I think that's how that's how it should be it makes sense now terribly poor I'm wasn't wealthy if I make a group with with a decent amount of mine that's what I was told it I don't believe so I don't want to speak out of school though we need a BJ Penn did you know BJ Penn is a legend BJ grew up with a wealthy family they're wealthy he just was a fighter is it so hard once you got bored so I still want to do it he actually look very good in his last fight up until what time you got very glad you're back in the day wild man you still want but he blocked by Ryan Hall who's this is phenomenal Jiu-Jitsu player and he he he caught him with us he did a m Inari roll and caught him in a leg lock

<timemark seconds="8252" />

foxes like a m and re-roll very famous Japanese fighter who is a phenomenal leglock artist and this actually two moves is to visit imanari roll and there's a m n r e M & R E comes from Alma Plata an omoplata is a shoulder lock I think it said the Portuguese word I think that's what they called Almost blocks on get your luggage from your leg and then the mnre is while you're locked up in the alma Plata you grab like a grip on these guys cinta Yang come back to Nancy now I'll show you tomorrow I hope not I really hope not whether it's coming I'm a big fan of the in arm choke which I know is your favorite

<timemark seconds="8312" />

no cuz of the Joe Hogan someone that's your move you've actually it's now your move at the gym techniques that you you hit so often that you just know when they're there you can close them up real quick then that was always my shit that's what I've been I've ever since then I've actually been working on that we know so many guys did it to me and it's such a suffocating feeling when someone's on top of you enjoy your arm pinned here that next arms across your neck and you like it's such a horrible way to get choked out named after them how do you get out of it you have to put your hand on your ear like your answering the phone that's that's one then the first thing is you're trying to create some space here so that you don't go to sleep you got it you got it given to the fact that this guy is choking this side of your neck for sure so the arms coming under here and it's wrapping around here and if you just go like that and it's down or like that it's going to

<timemark seconds="8372" />

smushed you're getting getting smashed right so you got a little bit of space here create a little bit of space that's what you trying to do just give me a little bit of space at a time when it's all just a matter of inches little tiny micro movements but when someone has your arm wrapped up and they have their arm across your neck and crushing you with their body weight and then they get their knee on your solar plexus and flat you out squeeze down horrible other fighters in other countries that don't go in MMA but they're unbelievable Fighters but they're not trying to show anybody that they're unbelievable Fighters no know those guys all get fucked up and they try to they think they do it because you start believing it and you have your students and they believe you're the master and

<timemark seconds="8430" />

prison Sean got in a fight, yeah he was kickboxing he actually had some skills like he needs to watch a show he can do a little bit she Masters like one of those ones where you put seems realer mcdojo what is the mcdojo life on Instagram has a shitload of those who was make me laugh so sad cuz they just get smashed open you know because you know why why I don't get it that's why that's why I love boxing in a boxing Spar all the time you got to hit all the time so

<timemark seconds="8489" />

in a real fight

<timemark seconds="8491" />

boxes of being hit you know guys up do kung fu and all those things they don't get hit so when they do get him a real fight so I can message them up as is practical application the difference between practicing and thinking this so many of these what is this guy doing I haven't seen this one this is a new one it's very d looks like the carpeting in my bedroom all my God

<timemark seconds="8519" />

what is it seems to believe that I can get him suck his dick same way I know people who really believe that their teacher can do that stuff they're called priests it's weird that those people still around in the day of video cameras that you can still have this but yeah what you're saying is probably evil you were saying that if you hadn't fought in two years and then you would get in there and get hit you later okay, do that last fight through that way

<timemark seconds="8579" />

concussion concussion and he was all right after that if you hit him with that same shot he would have took it even better because it got over the hump I still get a lot of people did Usher and how long has he been out two years at least it was he injured elbow

<timemark seconds="8606" />

you don't but that's also one of the things that makes it so interesting you know I mean when and what a guy does come back from a devastating loss and Hugo okay like like Manny Pacquiao Marquez not come out I mean crazy that was a bad one that was a bad one make a move and look move but then you've moved into the Man's power punch and he hits you and you know there's no second chance with that one yeah Marquez mean he's a he's an interesting case

<timemark seconds="8646" />

and I mean he's obviously a very very talented fighter but as he got older he got like physically stronger you got bigger and stronger you know Mexican supplements Mexican meat lot involved clenbuterol Monkey Juice involved there right I mean and he actually was working with Manny Pacquiao's old strength and conditioning guy and Manny was the guy was always accused of doing stuff I mean it Manny went up 8

<timemark seconds="8679" />

does he still fighting Floyd Pacquiao rematch I'm not really excited about that you know what I'm excited to see how much money Floyd Mayweather can make I'm excited I mean like the fucking the fact that he talked to everybody that Conor McGregor fight and he made more than a hundred million dollars to somebody else now. So, yeah he's a he's a badass is 126 pounds the fact that he fought Mayweather at all and people like all looks like was a fake fighting that's what it looks like 126-pound fighter fight one of the best boxers of all time if that's what it looks like they look fake agent very dramatically you know

<timemark seconds="8739" />

oh my God I can't make that wait anymore either that's the thing they just have a fight between Floyd and make any fucking weight is a lot for people don't know they don't let him cut weight hydration test so there's no dehydrating yourself so if you weighed natural you walk around 185 lb 85 lb not going to fight it 170 or 165 like a lot of these guys do the hydration aspects of even in any sport taking that liquid away from the brain your body needs liquid it's a Vibe it's terrible for you in every way terrible for your performance your internal organs are guys have kidney failure on a cutting weight for weigh-ins that's a beautiful thing about you being heavyweight right

<timemark seconds="8800" />

wait what everybody I was always that fighting weight where I would be perfect. Manny was good at that don't move don't move from there to 35235 is a perfect knew you were on it what kind of what kind of nutrition did you follow when you're fighting did you you did you take specific vitamins or specific things no just saw Jamaican food Jamaican food Angelo Dundee ask me that same question if it ain't broke don't fix it it's a perfect Angelo Dundee quote you're blowing it kid gets she should I get fired up and goes out and stops in the next round there's a lot of good trainers back

<timemark seconds="8860" />

who trained as well it's so important for young fighter to get hooked up with the right trainer right you know we got on that for a second I think part of the problem with a lot of the young kids right now they need to get good trainers yeah good trainers really help your game because even helps you with the with the TV because I was saying today that when a man you came into my corner HBO started talkin about me better before that it was like all we didn't throw the job enough he looks like he's tired the fight when I'd went with Manny they would like praising me always doing good now Max 90s behind and now he's a train of Champions so trainer really helps you your game at Mercer

<timemark seconds="8903" />

yes that was a war yeah I was actually no I wasn't I wasn't that Marissa fight actually taught to help me out because before that fight I was always fighting guys that hooked hooked around body shots and hook so I kept my hands like this at the side of my face then that and then I went into that fight got a fat lip hated a heikkinen fat lips in my fights did you win the fight yeah it didn't look like a fat lip from you know so I guess I'm walking around with a fat lip and then I got you I got a good picture of me and Lloyd he said you need to put your hand in front of your mouth like okay so even if a guy throws in a punch with slides doesn't slide through is going to hit your hand and he said you can move your hand to inches

<timemark seconds="8963" />

pictures of a mohawk

<timemark seconds="8966" />

okay you're right I'm no more fat lips having a great trainers it's it's it's so important in may as well I mean it's in there's not that many of them it's like you really have to find the right ones you know you can't just be a trainer or just be a form of fighter rather you have to be a student was only an amateur fighter Friday never fought professional and he was one of the greatest of all-time unquestionably like everybody respected him and so soft-spoken you know I'm just but just knew just knew how to raise Fighters you think about all the guys Gerald McClellan Tommy Hearns other great Fighters it came out of that camp the only problem I have with you know old-time Fighters is like you know some some old-time Fighters were bad Fighters and now right now they're training a young kid the same way Brian it's not it's not positive

<timemark seconds="9026" />

it's like a teaching them the bad tricks ya guys who are better as trainers and they were as Fighters like Freddie Roach a hundred percent alive but as a fighter was a journey with Tyson but he never really developed outside of the Tigers on a leash and my buddy had a good time with me yet what is a phone keeps throwing up and you're supposed to be out of here an hour ago but I appreciate your time and it was and it was an honor to sit here and talk to you thanks for having one of my favorites of all time in Brussels I like you too thanks man you're my favorite
